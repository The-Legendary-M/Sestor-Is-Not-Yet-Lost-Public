#Bunrodea is a matrilineal society. Nobles and high-ranking officials are predominantly female, while low-ranking ones are more mixed.

#To prove themselves to the Bunrodea, the player helps the Bunrodea to destroy a Korath raid into their territory.
#Fight should be very easy, the Bunrodea fleet is much stronger.

			`Ever since your introduction to the Bunrodea, your time in their planets has been very uneventful. Few Bunrodea ever approached you, and nobody have ever sought you out for any jobs. Bunrodean food is alright, and their deep-fried insects remind you strongly of deep-fried scampis you find back in human space. Yet, to get this sole relief from Bunrodean restaurants, you had to resort to gestures, pointing, and waving your credit chips around to get your point across.`
			`	Well, at least their cities are aesthetically pleasing, with their hexagonal architecture and many gardens blending into an impressive cityscape. And their lounges are spacious and affordable, compared to many places in the galaxy...`
			`	After you touch down on the spaceport, you expect little different from the usual: Bunrodea, old and young, scurrying across the spaceport, with few words exchanged even between fellow Bunrodeans. However, as you step out of the spaceship and emerge in the hallway, you notice two Bunrodeans standing beneath the mandatory portrait of the Queen.`
			`	"Hello," the Bunrodean on the left starts, "Hello, hello, hello."`
			choice
				`"Hello?"`
				`"How can I help you?"`
			
			`The Bunrodean on the left nods to the one to the right, as she produces a piece of paper, as well as a holographic projector. The Bunrodean on the right speaks.`
			`	"Human, human, human, human... Her Majesty, our Hegemon, the Queen has decreed that you are allowed to prove your worth to our Hegemony."`
			`	The Bunrodean on the left waves at the projector, causing it to come to life. The image it shows flickers for a bit, before stabilising to the familiar visage of a Palavret.`
			`	"The Korath is our ancestral enemy, our worst foe. One such ship has appeared in the fringe system of Genta Bo. Destroy it, and our Queen shall grant you recognition."`
			choice
				`"Got it, I'll be on my way."`
					goto thshybothro
				`"Recognition? What does it do?"`
			`Our Queen's recognition will ensure your stay in our space, to be much more welcoming.`
			
			label thshybothro
			`	"When the invaders are destroyed, report to Thshybothro. This paper," the Bunrodea on the left hands you the paper, "shall grant you clearance to land."`
			choice
				`"Sure, I will do it."`
					accept
				`"Maybe later?"`
					defer
				`"No, I will not help you!"`

			`As your ship approaches the spaceport's pads, you notice a large crowd being dispersed by the enforcers. By the time you power down the repulsors, the only people remaining near the landing pad is a small squad of Bunrodea soldiers.`
			`	The leader, visibly larger and with many medals pinned to her uniform, steps forwards.`
			`	"Hello, hello, hello, hello... Human, human, human, human..."`
			`	It seems that the repeating words are how Bunrodea communicates.`
			`	"Your battle with the Korath raider has been notified to Her Majesty, and she is pleased by your brilliant victory. You have proven your worth to the Bunrodean Hegemony, and she has granted you her recognition.`
			`	"From today on, you shall be treated as one of our own, and is entitled to accept commisions from Her Majesty's government, as well as independent contractors."`
			`	From her suitcase, the leader retrieves a headphone, and hands it to you.`
			`	"Take this, human. While I, and a few other learned individuals can speak and understand Human, other people of lesser strata, may not be able to understand. This is a translation device which will allow you to take quests directly.`
			`	"Fulfil our quests, and Her Majesty may yet grant you greater rewards."`
			`	With that, the leader waves you off. As you look at the job board next to the spaceport, you find a few that you can take. The Bunrodea has indeed opened their job market to you.`
