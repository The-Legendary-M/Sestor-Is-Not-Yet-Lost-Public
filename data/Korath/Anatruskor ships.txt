	description "During the first stages of their civil war, the Korath developed this autonomous freighter as the backbone of their deliveries across their space. Today, hundreds of years after the end of the war that nearly brought their species to an extinction, the Lilot-class Courier remains the primary freighter of surviving Korath factions."

	description `The I'tak Korati, or the "Korath Shipper", is an old design used by the Korath mainly for exploration and to transport small groups of people. With the start of the Civil War, the Shipper's niche has mostly diminished, and only a small number of Shippers is still produced.`





#Anatruskor drones. Korath love using drones for warfare.

#Naming scheme: First syllables, then number.
#PK-117s are the main Anatruskor warships, with its six turret mounts allowing the installation of large and powerful weaponry.
#Old Korath Raider sprite looks so clean and pristine, so I chose it as the basis of Anatruskor drones.

	description "Developed after years of Sestor-Anatruskor technological exchange, the PK-117 is the first Anatruskor ship wholly dedicated to warfare, and quickly becomes the mainstay of the Anatruskor Navy. Armed with top-of-the-line Anatruskor weaponry, the PK-117 is a sight to behold in the battlefield. The large outfit space and turret points allow for the installation of many defensive systems and turrets to ensure maximum survivability."

	description "The LM-15, or the Small Arrestor, is the standard fighter employed by the Anatruskor Empire, widely used in all Anatruskor fleets from its invention all the way to its final days trapped on Spera Anatrusk. Armed with potent ion weapons, a swarm of these can quickly drain their targets of energy, allowing stronger capital ships to easily disable them without taking any damage."
	description "	Fighters do not come equipped with a hyperdrive. You cannot carry a fighter unless you have a ship in your fleet with a fighter bay."

	description "A predecessor to the Palavret-class raiding vessels that the Exiles wield, the KT-class raiders were produced and deployed en masse by the Anatruskor Empire to raid southern Hai worlds for supplies and resources. This version, the Ik'ih 200, are KT's re-fitted to serve as transportation."
	description "	Without the need of luxurious bunkers and amenities as seen in dedicated raiding vessels like the Palavret, this passenger vessel has a far larger passenger capacity than its raider counterparts. This, however, comes at the cost of much-reduced armour and shielding. "
