	description "During the first stages of their civil war, the Korath developed this autonomous freighter as the backbone of their deliveries across their space. Today, hundreds of years after the end of the war that nearly brought their species to an extinction, the Lilot-class Courier remains the primary form of cargo transportation across Korath space, run by all surviving Korath factions alongside their other ships."


#Anatruskor drones. Korath love using drones for warfare.

#Naming scheme: First syllables, then number.
#PK-117s are the main Anatruskor warships, with its six turret mounts allowing the installation of large and powerful weaponry.
#Old Korath Raider sprite looks so clean and pristine, so I chose it as the basis of Anatruskor drones.

	description "Developed after years of Sestor-Anatruskor technological exchange, the PK-117 is the first Anatruskor ship wholly dedicated to warfare, and quickly becomes the mainstay of the Anatruskor Navy. Armed with top-of-the-line Anatruskor weaponry, the PK-117 is a sight to behold in the battlefield. The large outfit space and turret points allow for the installation of many defensive systems and turrets to ensure maximum survivability."

	description "A predecessor to the Palavret-class raiding vessels that the Exiles wield, the KT-class raiders were produced and deployed en masse by the Anatruskor Empire to raid southern Hai worlds for supplies and resources. This version, the Ik'ih 200, are KT's re-fitted to serve as transportation."
	description "	Without the need of luxurious bunkers and amenities as seen in dedicated raiding vessels like the Palavret, this passenger vessel has a far larger passenger capacity than its raider counterparts. This, however, comes at the cost of much-reduced armour and shielding. "
