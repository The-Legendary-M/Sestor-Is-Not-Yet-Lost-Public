	description "Ralukut pellets are composed of the most toxic and corrosive compounds known to the Korath, and their potential as weapons is quickly realised. Hence, the resourceful Korath Exiles quickly created a series of weapons to utilise this fact."

	description `Facing increasingly powerful Efreti and Korsmanathi enemies, the Anatruskor Empire desperately searched for a solution, a weapon that can defeat ships of both rival Korath states and the Hai alike. The Thunder-Lance is the result.`
	description `	The pinnacle of Korath beam technology, the Thunder-lance shoots a concentrated beam of positively-charged halogen ions at enemies. Not only do these highly unstable ions interfere heavily with the target's computer systems, the presence of such intense electromagnetic field disrupts the targets' shield matrix enough for other anti-hull weapons to pass through more easily.`

	description `While developing the Thunder-Lance, Anatruskor engineers frequently had to cut down the scale of certain components, in order to fit the gun inside the small gun ports of Anatruskor automata. Mounting the weapon on a turret mount, however, does not have such size restrictions, and hence the full suite of the original design can be incorporated, resulting in this slightly more powerful beam.`

	description `The Heavy Shock-Strike turret is an extremely powerful weapon, but its large size heavily impedes its versatility and usage.

	description "When Sestor engineers designed the Tek Ot Rah 681 capital ship, they needed larger thrusters so it could catch up to prey held by its four Detainers. Any thrusters beyond Stellar Class simply melted themselves; the Korath could not manufacture a material to handle such high temperatures. For the longest time, this development bottleneck prevented the TOR-681 from ever reaching completion. Fresh insights from acquired Efreti Graviton-plasma hybrid thrusters, however, finally granted the Sestor the technological breathrought they needed, combining an anti-gravity field generator with their existing massive plasma thrusters."

	description "The high mass of the Tek Ot Rah 618 initially made Sestor engineers give up on any prospects for the ship to turn at an acceptable rate. The development of the Grav-thruster, however, brought back the possibility of the capital ship being a respectably mobile war platform. A pair of slightly scaled down Grav-thrusters, this steering system incorporates anti-gravity to accelerate the propelled plasma far beyond what the engine can manage on its own. The engine was first tested on a Met Par Tek 53; the ship spun so fast its Piercer missiles flew out of their racks and hit the hull."
