#"Kor Sestor" refers to the pre-invasion Sestor state (when FL doesn't know about them other than "killing machines"). "Sestor Federation" refers to the one after.

#Unlike what the Wanderers and the Kor Efret predicted, the Sestor Federation, a nation that had been in a constant state of war for centuries, do not die off after a single sack of its capital. They survived countless Mereti attacks, and they would survive that single Alpha assault that lasted less than a month long. 
#The Sestor Federation did lose most of its ships and leadership in the attack. But like any competent government, backup plans exist. Currently, the Sestor Federation operates out of the bunker world of Sopi Lefarkata.

			`It has been a long time since the factories in Sestor Ikfar were shut down. With much fewer pollutants in the air, the ever-present smog over the planet has all but dissipated. You leave your ship, setting foot on the dusty concrete pad from which Kor Sestor drones used to take off and land. You can still see a few unrepaired drones in nearby hangars, all heavily damaged in battles years ago.`
			`	The spaceport is heavily damaged. A gigantic collapsed building is visible to the north,and the asphalt road leading to it is riddled with with scorch marks, bones, and barricades. The Sestor Korath here must have put up a fierce fight against the Alpha invasion.`
			`On the stretch of desert land near the hangars, two skeletons lie tangled against each other, a human one and a giant lizard skeleton you presume to be that of a Korath. You can only imagine the last moments of the Alpha fighter and the Sestor Korath, simultaneously striking killing blows against each other. The Korath's uniform lay torn and tattered, revealing a brightly-coloured metal plate. The plate's design is remarkably similar to a Republic ID card, with a photo of a Korath in the left, and short lines of symbols in the right. An ornate red logo lay near its top.`
			`	You pick up the plate. It must be a form of identification for this Sestor korath.`
			`Retrieving a shovel from your ship's cockpit, you untangle the two skeletons, and bury them where they lay. May the two rest in peace.`
			`	As you wander around the abandoned spaceport, you find a gigantic Kar Ik Vot 349 attached to a robotic tug in a secluded taxiway. Apparently, the tug was deactivated just before the warship was scheduled to launch. The Korath Exiles must have missed this ship as they looted this base.`
			`You climb up onto the tug, where an oval-shaped red LED button shone brightly in the shadows. Curious, you press the button. The button turns blue, as the tug begins to move. A faint whirr of the tug's motor signified its electric nature, as the tug tows the Kar Ik Vot 349 to a vacant launchpad next to your flagship. The tug stops, disconnects from the warship, and heads back towards the spaceport.`
			`Mindful of the ship's Kor Sestor origin, you climb up into the warship's interior. The door you blast open during space boarding, as it turns out, can be easily opened using the Sestor ID plate. A brief scan later, the Kar Ik Vot 349's main door opened.`
			`	You walk into the narrow corridor of the drone battleship. Just like the many times before where you captured a Sestor drone off-world, you replace the ship's IFF identification data with yours. The gigantic Sestor ship is yours.`

#Ikagalef? Derived from Megawati, the fourth Indonesian president, and the one name I feel Korath-like after the flip and letter replacement stuff.
#Yes, the exoskeleton thing is a Korath-Hai translator (very useful during Korath-Hai raids). Plugging it into a Hai-Human translator yields a Korath-Human translator. Due to both being designed for diplomatic use, the languages are made to be as polite as possible, hence the flowery tone.
#Korath use simple words and gestures to communicate. The exoskeleton translator picks up both to translate. Hence it's an exoskeleton.
#Feels like this mission is so long, but I like describing the environment. So mote it be.
#Korath seem to be neither male nor female. Using the pronouns it/it because I want to reserve they/them for groups of Korath to reduce confusion.
#For the story to work Ikgalef must be a competent, likeable person. Anybody else the Sestor is dead.

			`For a moment, you forget that this was once a Kor Sestor world. A scene straight out of New Austria, snowcapped mountains and boundless forests make up most of the landscape. Flying reptiles and birds can be seen swooping in the sky. Through your ship's inbuilt ground scanner, you can see slight disturbances from beneath the trees. Animals. The juxtaposition of this serene, calm world in a region of space ravaged by centuries of warfare is jarring.`
			`	The uneven terrain means that there are little places suitable for landing. Any flatlands that might have once existed are riddled with craters, no doubt the result of Mereti bombardments. Finally, you spot a clearing in a secluded valley, slightly larger than a Heavy Warship's size, and land your ship there.`
			`	As a precaution against native predators, you bring your shotgun with you as you disembark your ship. Before you can relax, you notice insects immediately trying to fly into your ship via the open door. You immediately close the door and activate your ship's environmental control system. The insects should be dealt with shortly. Other than the faint hissing sound from your ship winding down, there is no artificial noises.`
			`	The slightly yellow, waist-high grass and the faint noises of alien fauna is soothing and therapeutic, reminding you of your homeworld of New Boston. Ah, even alien planets can feel familiar...`
			`	Just as you are about to finish your lunch, you sense sudden movement out of your left eye. You turn towards the source, but nothing seems to be there. As you begin to pack away your food, you see the movement again. Picking up your rifle, you turn to investigate the source. Is it a predator stalking you? Better safe than sorry.`
			`	After a brief chase, you finally see a pale white leg vanishing just a second too late. You speed up to catch it, but then you suddenly lose your footing and fall to the ground, face-first. You turn around, only to stare down the barrel of a Korath Thermal Repeater rifle. You freeze, slowly putting your hands up.`
			`	The two Korath pointing their guns to you are not like the Kor Efret seen in Laki Nemparu. Large scars run down their foreheads and cheeks, and their bodies are shorter and wider. The two Korath shout frantically in a language you do not understand, and after a while, they stop.`
			choice
				`	(Stand still)`
					goto still
				`	"I come in peace!"`
			`Both Korath do not seem to understand your words, and, instead, the left one took out a picture from its breast pocket.`
				goto then
			
			label still
			`	After a protracted period of silence, the Korath on the left rummaged through its breast pocket before it produced a photograph.`
			
			label then
			`	The photograph depicts a crouching human in standard camouflage. His hairless face, ugly with bulging eyes, is contorted into a nasty snarl. And unlike you, this man has green skin.`
			`	"Alpha?" the Korath on your left asks, the first word you recognise. The other Korath visibly tenses.`
			`	"Human, human," you answer. Uttering a single "Alpha" might make them think you are one, and your reply is best kept simple.`
			`	"Humani," the right Korath turns towards the left one, "Humani, Alpha po'of."`
			`	The atmosphere visibly loosens slightly after this exchange, as the Korath takes on a friendlier tone. It appears that these Korath consider the Alpha enemies, and claiming that you are an enemy to the Alpha has lowered their suspicion somewhat. The impromptu interrogation happened a little longer, but not much else meaningful is exchanged between the three of you. Notable, however, is how fast the Korath are at snatching a few hair strands that happened to fall off you. You are creeped out, but are in no position to stop it.`
			`	The left Korath gestures to the right one, who grunts and beckons you to follow it as it turns and leaves. From the bushes all around your ship, tens of Korath emerge, and go into formation around you.`
			`	The Korath leads you out of the forest clearing, into the forest itself. `
			choice
				`(continue)`
			`The forest on Sopi Lefarkata is rather similar to that of New Tibet. Tall trees shrouded in mist, with the occasional bushes here or there. The Korath take great care to avoid small hills with holes in them, which you assume to be the den of some kind of animal. Right in front of you, a large beetle-like insect jumps up, and catches a small bird that was drinking nectar from a large, blue flower.`
			`	The Korath stop abruptly in front of a particularly large and bulbous tree. For a second, you worry whether the Korath are about to execute you. Fortunately, instead of shooting you, the Korath grabbed the thickest exposed tree root, and lift it up. The tree root turns out to be a disguise for a control panel, and a single press of an oval green button reveals a hidden doorway on the left that leads downwards. The Korath usher you into the doorway. A press of the oval red button in the doorway closes the opening.`
			`	The doorway beyond is brutalist, the greyish-colour of concrete occasionally defaced by what you assume to be the Korath language. The Korath usher you into a zone outlined in red, before one of them speak into a black rectangle. A gigantic automatic turret pop down from the ceiling, pointing at you, before retracting after the Korath mutter something more.`
			`	The door open to reveal a large cavern, much bigger than any you have ever seen. Thousands of buildings dot the hollowed-out area where Korath constantly stream in and out of. You can feel the heat emanating from lamps above and light tubes lining the walkways. Gigantic hangars are present, near what appears to be a launch platform facing a dark valley. Curiously, however, you see no ships launching or landing as expected from a settlement this large. Some mechanics are working on Far Lek 14's and Far Osk 29's, the only spacecraft visible here. Large greenhouses and algae tanks are visible, which probably provide the Korath food.`
			`	The Korath around you march you down to a giant bus-sized pod, which floats along metal roads towards a large building. In the building stands even more Korath with guns. Before long you find yourself facing the what appears to be the Korath's leader. The leader, sitting on a brown, leather chair, turns towards you. The two Korath guards steps back in unison, and march out. After a few, deafening seconds, the Korath leader speaks.`
			`	"Greetings, humani."`
			choice
				`	"Hello."`
				`	"How do you know my language?"`
					goto language
				`	"I come in peace!"`
			`"You are not Alpha," says the Korath leader, "Why are you here?"`
			`	"I was just exploring this region of space," you reply truthfully, "I though you were dead."`
			`	The Korath leader flares his nostril, as a loud snort rings your hears.`
			`	"Bah, those green kalabet do not kill all Korath. They do not know here. We do not have visitors. Why do you know us?"`
			`	"I was here before," you reply, "Your ships always shot at me."`
			`	"We do not know any ships other than the ke'epek Mereti. Only us and po'of fly here. We shoot everyone."`
			`	Although it is clear that their aggressive policy was what prevented visitors from coming, antagonising the leader with many soldiers staring at you, is obviously unwise.`
			`	"How do you know my language?" You ask, dropping the matter entirely.`
			label language
			`	"The green kalabet, 'Alphas' they call themselves, land in Sestor Ikfar, our capital, and talk with us, saying they want to learn," the Korath leader says with disdain, "Lies, ralukut lies. Steal our ships and guns, kidnap Korath like livestock, and hold our leaders at gunpoint..."`
			`	The Korath leader starts to tremble, as his words increase in pitch, conviction, and speed, "Then they build a black ralukut. Defile our dance into their words. Despicable heresy! They do not know Sopi Lefarkata. We know them. We in Sopi Lefarkata learn Alpha tongue. We understand Alpha kalabet ralukut. We are not fooled. You are humani. Humani is Alpha po'of. You are good. You are rafeki."`
			`	The rant is evidently exhausting for the Korath leader, as he begins to visibly pant. These are Sestor Korath, who survived the Alpha attack. Needless to say, they are now sworn enemies of the Alpha.`
			`	"So, I am here merely to explore. I have no other intentions. I, like all humans, consider Alphas the enemy," you say, as you start to show the leader the same holograph videos you showed to the two guards.`
			`	The Sestor leader visibly frowns, and opens his mouth to answer. However, he is interrupted by his aide, who brings him a tablet alongside what is probably your hair they plucked earlier. On it a red symbol is present. Upon viewing, however, the leader visibly relaxes. A gesture later, all the soldiers guarding the hall did the same.`
			`	"You do not need to prove, humani. The Sestor trust you."`
			`	The Korath leader tilts his head, and taps his head before pushing his palm out to you. As you tilt your head in confusion, the Korath freezes, eyes going wide.`
			`	"Travellor," the Korath leader says, "I realise you do not know me. I am Ikgalef. President of the Sestor Federation."`
			`	"Captain <first> <last>, of New Boston," you reply in kind.`
			`	With most of the suspicion between you and Ikgalef gone, the conversation takes on a lighter tone. Ikgalef starts by recounting the history of the Sestor. The Sestor Federation is one of the many Korath nations, alternating between war and peace for the past few centuries. Unfortunately, dramatic escalation of warfare due to a revolution in what was the "Mereti Collective" led to a Korath-wide civil war, and the Sestor had been fighting non-stop for three centuries. Until the Mereti suddenly stop attacking the Sestor a short while ago, and a surprise Alpha raid on Sestor Ikfar. Fearing another attack, the Sestor went into hiding, enacting radio silence, grounding all their ships, and stopping all surface activities.`
			`	In return, you tell the Sestor leader about the whole situation about the Wanderers' struggle against the Unfettered Hai, their mission to terraform planets, the pacification of the Mereti drones, and how the stolen Sestor drone ordeal was resolved. Ikgalef visibly frown, but makes no comment.`
			`	Ikgalef listens to your tale attentively, and by the end, he, and the Korath around him, have mostly dropped their guards.`
			`	"Humanika," Ikgalef says, "Unlike us, you wander freely without the others shooting you. The Sestor has a request."`
			choice
				`"Sure, go ahead"`
				`"No, I merely wish to leave this planet."`
			label final
			`	"Humanika," Ikgalef continues, "We receive a message, a brief message from Sestor Ikfar. When Alpha attack our capital, they kill most of us. We think they are all dead, but we receive one requesting rescue. We cannot go. Do go there when you are free."`
			`	The spaceport is fully sealed from the outside, and to take off, the gigantic port doors must open. Fortunately, as you schedule your leave, the spaceport doors open for you. You are now able to freely travel to Sestor owned land.`
			`	You are now able to enter and leave Sopi Lefarkata as you please.`

			`Sestor Ikfar is just as desolate as you remembered last time. The spaceport still lies in ruins, and the city centre itself remains lifeless. Most of the fires that have sprung up in the months following the Sestor's downfall have already burnt out, their fuel all but spent.`
			`	The Sestor have requested you check out the planet, to look for stragglers, and you are vigilant for any sign of intelligent life here. Maybe there are ships or other valuables underneath the rocks, buried somewhere accessible for you to salvage.`
			`	As you wander around with your handy search droids, hope grows thin. No signs of life can be found, even with the Sestor-provided radio. Most of the hangars that were standing months ago have already collapsed, destroying anything that is accessible. As you are about to call it a day, your infrared sensor picks up a signal. And in front of you, the signal changes position.`

			`	You carefully move towards the signal, which points to a point behind a particularly large piece of collapsed wall. You turn the corner, gun raised, and in front of you stand 4 Korath. 2 of them are larger, at around the same height as you, and the other two are much younger and shorter.`
			`	It is clear that they meant to move first, with the way their fingers clench on broken pieces of concrete rebar, and their braced poses looking ready to pounce. They are a bit too slow, however, and it is not hard to see why. The Korath you see here, are distinctly impoverished, skeletons visible through baggy, sagged skin. Even the Korath you saw in Laki Nemparu, already somewhat malnourished, are in better shape than them.`

You make way for the Korath family, who walk past you towards the crowd. A short conversation soon follows, the Korath family frequently gesturing towards you.`

The once abundant skyscrapers and factories are all but destroyed due to the Alpha invasion, and, thus, the once sprawling city lies in complete ruins."

		spaceport "The former spaceport of Sestor Ikfar, a large landing pad linked to massive passageways leading directly to the factories, serves as a rudimentary spaceport now. Debris and rubble is cleared from the spaceport complex, and small robot workers can be seen building a spaceport complex right around this singular landing pad."

		description `Although hostile to life, this desert planet is home to a bustling metropolis teeming with Korath life. Large skyscrapers, some completely new, some painstakingly rebuilt as those destroyed by the Alpha, feature prominently on the horizon. A metro system similar to that in Sopi Lefarkata serves the planet capital's millions of inhabitants, and high-speed rails connect the capital city with various outlying settlements. Large arrays of solar panels fill the landscape outside of cities, powering the cities and the many moisture farms that provide citizens with water.`
		description `	Large train tracks fill the formerly empty passageways in the factory zone, with self-piloting locomotives delivering various raw and processed goods to and from them. A number of factories are delegated towards education, where aspiring Sestor engineers put their novel ideas into action.`
		description `	Retractable barriers and automated turrets are found in every road and building, both inside and outside cities, making any potential invasion extremely difficult and costly.`
		spaceport `The sprawling spaceport of Sestor Ikfar is the grandest throughout Sestor space. A 150-metre-tall monument is featured prominently in the Spaceport's central square as a reminder of the Alpha invasion. Surrounding the central square are large amounts of shops selling clothes, food, and souvenirs, and directly behind, the largest train station in Sestor Ikfar. Everything in this spaceport is automated, as thousands of robotic cars and mechas carry passengers and cargo directly from the train station or the reception area to their waiting spaceships. Hundreds of Gauss cannons, laser cannons, and plasma turrets can be seen throughout the spaceport, no doubt to prevent another invasion from the skies.`

			`It seems that the Korath workers on Sestor Ikfar has been hard at work, for it did not take them long to set up a substantial base on the sacked planet's ruins.`
			`	However, by the looks of the construction equipment nearby being idle, and the workers wandering around, it seems that an they have reached an impasse.`
			`	"Humani Captain <last>," a faint voice calls out, diluted by the howling desert winds, "Sestor Ikfar, capital!" You look in the direction, and Ikgalef waves at you. By the lack of transport ships moving between the planets, he must have stowed away in the I'tak Korati you escorted here a while ago.`
			`	Ikgalef continues speaking.`
			`	"Our capital, the largest shipyard of all Korath, Sestor Ikfar is," Ikgalef puffs his chest out, "Kalabet Alpha steal it from us, and we take it back. We build it up again!"`
			`	The timing of this boast cannot be worse, as just after he finishes his speech, a massive industrial chimney near the spaceport collapses, generating a massive smoke cloud that is heading towards the two of you, and the Korath workers. Fortunately, air purification facilities have been installed by some of the engineers in a nearby shelter, and all the carcinogens and toxins floating around in the air thankfully cannot reach your lungs. Huddled in the shelter are other engineers in the vicinity, who seem to be discussing something.`
			`	Ikgalef excuses himself, and starts talking to the engineers instead. After a flurry of wild gestures, and a small dance-off, he returns to you, slightly troubled.`

			`Sopi Lefarkata has visibly developed more since the last time you visited. A train station connected directly to the spaceport is built, although passengers here are rare. After all, the Sestor have not resumed space activities yet. Still, after a short phone call, a small train pulls up to the station, and the two of you board it.`
			`	A short train ride takes you two to a building a few minutes' walk away from the Sestor congress building. Security guards allow the two of you in after Ikgalef shows them a small card, and you two walk in.`
			`	The scene inside is surprisingly similar to a library you find back in human space. Thousands of books sit on rows of shelves, neatly arranged based on the colours on the book spines. Unlike a human library, however, the space is noisy, and food and drinks are served via a counter nearby. As Ikgalef approaches and talks to a clerk behind a desk nearby, you notice a pair of Korath handing each other small patches of scales, suspiciously like shed Korath skin. Then, they eat the skin in one bite, before washing them down with a large gulp of yellowish brown beverage.`

As microphones and cameras are thrust into his face, he starts dancing and speaking, occasionally gesturing towards the suitcase and you.`
			`	After a while, the reporters start to disperse, and Ikgalef approaches you.`

			`It has been a while since you helped the Sestor reclaim their capital of Sestor Ikfar, and the area around it has changed a bit. The amount of automation in Sestor settlements is insane, far exceeding those found in any other sectors in the Galaxy. While Korath are still mostly employed in the planet, most of the menial tasks and manual labour work are done by, or at least heavily augmented by, robots.`
			`	Which means that, the scene before you, is the largest Sestor gathering you have seen so far. Unlike Ikgalef's entourage, who seems to be content, and the average working class Korath, with their apathetic looks and swift movements, these Korath look more agitated. Their dances are more frantic than any you have seen before, and they occasionally chant words, something you do not understand.`
			`	A few of them seem to be holding up signs. Most of them have symbols you don't understand drawn on them, but a few have photos included. Prominently featured is one with a bowl of fish soup on it, adjacent to a crossed-out image of a spanner and a Met Par Tek 53. Another sign has a visually impoverished Korath holding a bowl up, staring at the camera.`
			`	It is pretty clear that this is a protest, and the Korath here seem to be lacking food supplies.`

			`<origin>, just like most planets in Sestor and Efreti space, has a large industrial centre. However, today, the factories do not seem to be working like normal. It has been this way ever since you set foot on Sestor space. Perhaps it is time to look closely.`
			`	A little closer look reveals the reason: The factories' inlets, usually filled with materials ready to be processed, lies empty. You can see a few factories adjacent working with limited supplies, but the vast majority of the industrial area lies dormant.`
			`	Outside of the factories, you see workers moping around, doing nothing productive. In fact, you can see a few run-down factories with signs on locked doors. A few construction vehicles pass by, their large demolition balls clearly visible.`

			`Just as you finish your post-landing checklist, you hear sirens scream all across the Sestor planet. Immediately, pedestrians run towards cover, the lights are switched off, and, soon after, the entire city seems abandoned.`
			`	A few minutes later, you see the distant shadows of a Kor Mereti patrol overhead. They slow down above the planet, circle over the city a few times, before vanishing into deep space.`
			`	A little while later, the siren sends out a much more subtle noise, and the Korath re-emerge from their hiding place, and city life resumes as normal.`

			`Compared to last time, Sestor Ikfar is much more developed. Most of the rubble, including the chimney you saw collapsing last time, have been cleared out, and new buildings and roads are being built. In the distance, you see the outlines of new columns and chimneys being hoisted up, no doubt part of large factories under construction.`
			`	"Pi'at Afilek, Humanika Captain," Ikgalef greets you amiably as he approaches you, "Sestor Ikfar develops, and factories come online! We become complete soon!"`
			`	By the way Ikgalef gestures, dancing up and down and swaying and sashaying rapidly, he is in a very good mood indeed.`
			`	The universe, however, seems to have a different plan.`

Before either of you can react, a large rumble rings out across the spaceport. Ikgalef and you look towards the source of the noise. It seems that one of the factory demolitions did not go as planned, and the collapsing chimney crashed into another factory instead. Then, the familiar siren sounds, and the Korath scatter in all directions, leaving the spaceport empty within minutes.`
			`	"..."`

			`	Soon enough, the Mereti patrol ahead leaves the system, and the Korath re-emerges again, resuming their normal activities. The television resumes its broadcast, now showing protestors burning Ikgalef portraits. Ikgalef takes an audible deep breath, and starts speaking again.`
			`	"Humanika Captain," Ikgalef says, his voice tired and somewhat hoarse, "This..."`
			`	Ikgalef clears his throat for a bit, before continuing.`

		description `	The Sestor Korath have recently settled on this planet again, intending to continue their asteroid crashing modus operandi. Already, shields are being constructed around the settlements, as robot workers run around the grid cities to trim duplicate infrastructure.`

		description `With thousands of aluminium, iron, and titanium asteroids being towed down and broken up every day, Keneska Fek boasts the highest metal output volume throughout Korath Space, and possibly the entire Milky Way. Compared to crashing asteroids down, as it was done for centuries, towing them down using sublight drones has proven to increase production levels by over 500%.`
		description `	The grid pattern is still visible in settlements, but the buildings are all specialised now. Huge, 3000mm-gauged railways haul hundreds of thousands tonnes of metal ores from asteroids to refineries, where they would be processed and shipped off-world to construct various machinery.`
		description `	With most industrial processes being autonomous, there is little need for Korath labour here. Hence, the population on this planet is small at only about one million.`
		spaceport `Keneska Fek's spaceport is remarkably simple, with rows of landing pads leading directly to the entrance. The access roads are wide and made of reinforced concrete, enabling gigantic vehicles to haul gigantic blocks of metals directly to departing freighters.`

#Korath diplomacy: Sestor and Anatruskor had been at war with Efreti-Korsmanath when Simlisti fell to a coup to form Mereti. Hence Sestor launched a surprise attack on Mereti. War becomes melee-a-trois between Efreti-Korsmanath, Sestor-Anatruskor, and Mereti. Sestor never peaced out with Efreti, and have no intention to do so. As Anatruskor falls, refugees find themselves flying into Sestor land. Being pluralistic (accepting of different cultures rather than integrating them), Anatruskor identity remains strong in Sestor Federation.
#Ninth mission: A discussion about the emerging Sestor fleets. An introduction to the Anatruskor.
#Setting up for the juicy, juicy political mess that will mark the second act.

				`Sasirka Gatru is very weird when viewed from space. Despite having a normal, blue-tinted atmosphere and many water oceans on the surface, the many continents there are utterly devoid of the green or purple that photosynthetic species have. Scanners built in your ship blares off warnings about the extreme levels of organic toxins present in the atmosphere, as you choose a place to land.`
				`	Similar to what happened in Firka Tesk, you wait for the Palavret-like transport to land on the same plateau as you. Unlike the many times you ran these Korath expeditions, the transport carries no organic Korath passengers. Instead, hundreds of robotic workers file out, before starting to construct a sealed habitat for your passengers to move into. After an hour, the habitat is deemed complete, and your passengers leave your ship via an extended walkway. You check your bank account, noting that the promised 200000 credits have been transferred successfully.`

			`Just months ago, the capital of the Sestor Federation was a lifeless, desolate desert. Now, thanks to the efforts of you and the Sestor, the planet is now home to a vibrant, lifely community. The cities have been rebuilt, and, thanks to the influx of resources, industry is booming.`
			`	The spaceport's television screen you are watching switches from the news broadcast into a panoramic view of the cityscape, now filled with high-rise buildings and neon signs. In the distance, you see the massive Sestor Ikfar Shipyard, the largestin Korath space, coming to life, as plumes of smoke rise from its many chimneys. Trains now no longer empty themselves at the spaceport, as thousands of workers now commute one stop further into their posts at the shipyards.`
			`	Once again, you see the familiar face of Ikgalef meeting you as you step out from your ship. Unlike most other times, however, there is no mission this time. Instead, Ikgalef invites you to a dinner in one of Sopi Lefarkata's most exquisite restaurants.`
			`	Fine dining is a rarity for you. As a starship captain, most meals you have are either simple sandwiches you make in your ship, quick pasta dishes you cook in your ship's rudimentary kitchen, or cheap meals you eat in local restaurants or spaceport cafeterias. The celebration meal you had with your parents when you graduated with flying colours in your elementary school back in New Boston was one such rare instance. Apart from that, only the occasional state dinners you had with the leadership of the Free Worlds come to mind.`
			`	Korath fine dining is rather different from human fine dining. Hardly ever do you see wrestling rings or gun ranges in formal human restaurants. You also fail to remember the presence of giant billboards that allow you to post scribbled stickies on.`
			`	Seeing your shocked look, Ikgalef chuckles.`
			`	"Why are you so shocked? Fine dining should be fun! Nothing heals stressed-out Korath more than a few punches and a few drawings of your own!"`
			`	It seems that the Korath idea of a "fine" dining is rather different from what humans consider one to be.`
			`	Ikgalef and you sit down on a table a little distance away from the wrestling ring. "Better, viewing from distance," claims Ikgalef. As Ikgalef converses with the waiter what it wants, you look at the menu. Amongst the familiar images of fish steak, salad, stews and baked dishes, you see a soup bowl with weird, grey balls. Feeling adventurous, you point at that to the waiter, successfully ordering your dish non-verbally.`
			`	In the wrestling ring, two Korath are engaged in a fierce boxing match. While the punches are fierce, you can see that both are acting with great restraint. Then, astonishingly, before first blood is drawn, the Korath visibly in a disadvantage surrender, a rather disappointing end for you. Before you can ponder any more, your dish arrives.`
			`	The dish up close looks more appetising than the one in photos, although that's not a high bar to cross. Within the grey blobs you can see little pieces of yellow-white reflective tissue. You poke at it with your fork, discovering that the savoury blob is strangely elastic and "bouncy" in a way. The milky-white soup has a hint of sweetness within its umami flavour. The food is brilliant. Sestor cuisine is exquisite.`
			`	"Blended fish," introduces Ikgalef, shoving a piece of fish into his mouth, "It's made of all the parts in a bony fish blended together."`
			`	Just like that, you banter with Ikgalef as you both enjoy your meals in the rowdy establishment. The topics drift quickly, going from talking about human and Korath foods (No, Ikgalef, shrimp shells are not eaten), to sport events ("How is football a sport without fighting?" shouted Ikgalef), to space combat experience (You are better with tactics, commanding a fleet in many battles, while Ikgalef is better with strategies, having constantly fought against the Mereti), and finally to the state of the Galaxy.`

			`	"Pi'at Afilek, Humanika Captain," Ikgalef says, laid back, "Sestor works now. Even full factories. We soon have fleets again. Then we go to the Wanderers after we beat the Mereti."`
			`	You tell Ikgalef about te Mereti's non-hostility, and their connection to the Wanderers.`
			`	"The Wanderers... They do not know better," Ikgalef says, "The Efreti whisper poison to them, like the Alpha whisper them to us. We will go to Spera Anatrusk and talk with them soon. We wake them up. The hour draws near. Sestor Ikfar is back, and the Sestor Fleet return soon.`

			`	"Spera Anatrusk, and the surrounding systems, are colonised by the Wanderers, a group of aliens originating from the North," you say, as you start giving him a brief introduction of the bird-like alien species based up north.`
			`	Ikgalef stays silent, as you talk about the Wanderers' terraforming mission, and laughs derisively when you mention the Wanderers evacuating their northern planets when the Unfettered Hai invade.`
			`	"Unfettered Hai? You mean the Hai? Brown fur, hairy tail, pronounced snout?"`
			`	"Yes," you reply.`
			`	"The Hai," Ikgalef comments, "Are thieves, cowards, and swindlers. They stab those who sign treaties with them. 'Unfettered' is but a front, the Jump Drive deal can never work."`
			`	When you start mentioning the Wanderers going into Korath space and colonising them, Ikgalef visibly tenses. When you mention the Efret, and that the Wanderers are collaborating with them to terraform the worlds, Ikgalef stabs his spoon on his bowl with so much force the spoon bends.`
			`	"E-efreti? Laki Nemparu, purple markings? The Wanderers... Partner with Efreti?"`
			`	"Yes," you confirm.`
			`	"Kalabet traitors they are!" shouts Ikgalef, flace flushed, "They are born Korath, yet cheat and betray like the Hai. They flaunt their Korath feathers, yet hide behind the Quarg like slaves. Their honour is as nonexistent as their backbone. Isi'i weeps when she hears the term 'Efret' spoken. And now they trick the Wanderers into settling Anatruskor territory... Pabfa! Trash! Lowest of the low!`
			`	"If we do nothing, the Wanderers shall be misguided into following the Efreti's heresy! We must stop them, we must meet with them.`
			`	"But before that, our fleet must be ready. Meet me at the spaceport later."`

			`You can already tell that much has changed since your last visit of the Sestor capital. Large crowds can already be seen crowding your landing pad, even before you touch down. Massive banners, some with slogans written on them, some with your face printed on them, are flown by much of the crowd. The spaceport is alive with hundreds of excited Korath scurrying everywhere, chatting excitedly with one another. Journalists can be seen gathering around you and your ship, their cameras flashing frequently.`
			`	As you leave your ship, a group of Sestor officials accompany you to an impromptu stage set up in the middle of the spaceport, where a group of Korath, lead by Ikgalef, are waiting for you.`
			`	"Greetings, Humanika Captain!" says Ikgalef, "Because of your effort, the Sestor Federation is whole again! This is the day we celebrate our rise! I give speech in Korath soon. You do not understand it yet, so I prepare a translation of it for you."`
			`	The speech, going off by the translated transcript, seem to be a standard politician's message to the nation, informing them about your, and Ikgalef's, heroic deeds bringing the Kor Sestor back to whole again. In the middle of his speech, Ikgalef gestures at you, and you stand as the Korath applaud you by pawing at their chests.`
			`	Near the end of the speech, Ikgalef gives a wild gesture towards the sky. In unison, a massive Sestor drone fleet, parked in the spaceport, lift off in unison, and fly over the stage before pitching upwards towards the sky. Almost immediately after, a second fleet takes off, and trails behind the first. Then another lifts off, followed by yet more fleets. The automaton fleet seem endless from the ground; the massive Sestor fleet the Alpha took to strike Farpoint must have been but a fraction of the Sestor's true capabilities.`
			`	After a short question session, the celebrations truly begin, with free drinks and food being offered to everyone in the spaceport. As everyone is immersed in the joyous atmosphere, you see Ikgalef approach you.`
			`	"Humanika Captain <last>, I do not know enough Human to show how much we owe you. Because of you, we are saved from dying slowly in Sopi Lefarkata, and are instead thriving here.`
			`	"When the Drak come, they give us two choices. Join the traitors in Laki Nemparu, or go to the Core. We choose third option, to stay here, but the Archons demand our brightest and smartest to go. They think we all die, but we survive. Our economy runs. Our shipyards run. Our people live. The True Korath rise, and we shall never fall!"`
			`	You sit next to Ikgalef, as you watch the endless stream of Sestor drones taking off towards the cosmos. The Sestor are now allied to you, and the Wanderers are probably receptive to them. The Unfettered Hai up north may still be a problem, but that would be a question for tomorrow. Today, you can sit back and relax.`

After all, Wanderer psychology is different from human.`

			`	"Who fight and lose on purpose?" Ikgalef seems to disagree, "Nobody lose planets on purpose. You are just too embarrassed to admit defeat!"`
			`	"Those planets are not ours to claim! We merely terraform them then leave! The Keepers guide us, and the Eye lead us, to new planets! The ones we are standing on!" Rek, normally eternally cheerful, is also starting to become frustrated.`
			`	"Your ancestors work night and day, fight scale-and-claw for each planet they get, and now you flee on the first chance of escape. Have you no shame?"`
			`	"We do not fight for planets that is not ours," interrupts Rek, "You have not been listening to us."`

			`	"Then those planets are yours!" Ikgalef ejaculates angrily, "Your kind lives on the planets, not the Hai. Your kind build it up, not the Hai. Those planets are your territory, not the Hai's!"`

			`	A while later, as the transmission continues, it seems that the Sestor Space traffic control understands the voice as well, as a reply broadcast is made. After a short back-and-forth, the voices' tones get lighter, before stopping. The Korath captains beside you also gradually relax themselves, as the ships above turn towards the spaceport and land on one of the few empty pads.`
			`	When the ships approach the spaceport, you finally recongise the ships. Flanking the large new ship, are dozens of Palavret-class Rano'erek-class raiders, used by the Korath Exiles. As the doors of the landing ships open with a hiss, you can feel the Korath besides you squirm with confusion. Indeed, from within the ships, walks a group of Korath.`
			`	Ikgalef, with a Sestor entourage, is already at the spaceport entrance when the group emerges, and he quickly begins to talk to the group. At first, communication is rather ineffecive, as both sides' gestures and moves are incongruent, and seem to be rather rash and confused. However, after a while, they seem to be uable to start communicating.`
			`	Half an hour later, the Korath Exile visitors return to their ships. From within the ship, they retrieve a large plastic container. The Exiles then open it to Ikgalef, who gestures positively. The Exiles then hand the box to the Sestor, who quickly summon some workers to transport the box away. Suddenly, every Korath around you cover their ears and spin around. Then, you hear a voice that seems to come from your own mind.`
			`	"Those who hold onto Jump Drives shall not remain here," the voice says, "And those who have given up on Jump Drives shall not fabricate any."`
			`	The Korath around you then yelp in pain, but you feel nothing.`
			`	"We are watching," the presence warns.`
			`	With that, the voice fades. You gaze out of the periscope, and see Ikgalef and the Exile ambassador gesturing angrily at the sky. From their continued rants, the sky does not seem to be responding.`
			`	The Exiles, after shouting at the sky for a bit, transfer a few large contaners and a small suitcase to Ikgalef. After that, the Exiles board the ships, and take off into space.`

			`Just like many times before, you see the familiar face of Ikgalef waiting for you as you emerge in the spaceport.`
			`	"Come with me, Humanika Captain," he says.`
			`	You follow Ikgalef to the Sestor shipyard next to the spaceport. Ikgalef claimed many times before, that it is the largest one in Korath space, and the enormous complex shows. Clanks and clinks from ship parts coming together emerges from the factory buildings on both sides of the road you are walking on, and fleets of autonomous trains scurry past in the many train tracks throughout the complex every few minutes. Suddenly, the large entrance door to the factory on the left opens, and out rolls a brand-new Met Par Tek 53 pulled by a robotic tug. Soon, the spaceship starts its engines, and begin to taxi towards the spaceport.`
			`	Evidently, however, you are not here to see any of that. Ikgalef instead leads you to one of the smaller factories, inconspicuously tucked in the middle of two more buildings of the same design. Unlike the others, however, no shipbuilding noise can be heard from this building.`
			`	"Behold, Humanika Captain," Ikgalef says, "Our Stash."`
			`	The room is large, the weather control system whirring faintly in the background. In the centre of the room, surrounded by large, wooden boxes, stands a single peculiar device.`

			`	On top of a hexagonal platform, stands a hollow sphere made of multiple vertical twisted stripes. In the middle, a purple mass hovers quietly, as it slowly spins around.`
			`	"Spatial Inversion Chamber," Ikgalef says, standing besides the object, "Proudest Korath invention. Useful to make Jump Drives. Few other species make these."`
			`	As he speaks out the last sentence, however, Ikgalef suddenly clutches his head, as if in pain. A few moments pass, before Ikgalef grits his teeth and continue speaking.`
			`	"Alas, Humanika Captain, we cannot do it. The Drak forbid. We cannot fight them. We must obey."`
			`	From the tone Ikgalef spits out the final words, his distaste of such an idea is apparent.`
			`	"Kanra' kates..." He mutters.`
			`	Ikgalef shakes his head, before continuing.`
			`	"Regardless, the True Korath in the South, our brave brethren who defy the Drak, are alive. And they are Sestor allies. We have the ships, they have the weapons. The True Korath shall rise above the kalabet-pabfa in Laki Nemparu!"`
			`	As the two of you talk, you notice a Sestor engineer stuffing some sort of cloth into their mouth, before laying a piece of paper on a desk and begin sketching. Other engineers quickly move to the table, as the group ponders over the newly-drawn diagrams. In a separate section, a few engineers huddle near a workbench, as they work on a piece of electronics. The tube-shaped device seems to resemble the latter half of a Fire-lance.`
			`	Before long, your little visit comes to an end. As your bus carries you towards the city, the factory gradually blurs in the background, before becoming unrecognisable from the rest of the buildings.`

			`You have been staying in Sestor space for a long time, and the development you have witnessed is dramatic. From a small group of Korath hiding within a bunker in Sopi Lefarkata, the Sestor have since recovered and grown into a large, respectable nation. Their drone technology, augmented by the influx of knowledge the Korath and the Wanderers are bringing to them, means that they are now one of, if not the most, powerful Korath political entity around.`
			`	And it shows prominently in Sestor Ikfar. Running around grown-up Korath are groups of Korath children (or hatchlings, as Ikgalef puts it). These groups have only swole in size since you first helped the Sestor expand. Within a few generations, the Sestor may just fully return to their glory days, long lost in the destructive conflicts centuries before.`
			`	And the unending war with the Kor Mereti. And the Alpha sack of the very planet you are walking on. Time truly heals everything.`
			`	You do not know if the Sestor forgives. After all, they seem to hold centuries-long grudges against the Efret very well. But they definitely do not forget.`

We are lucky they do know know of Sopi Lefarkata, or we die as well. We survive this encounter, we fortify our planets, yet they may come in the future. We cannot let this happen."`

			`	"We will not stop until our revenge is complete," he said, "We will get to the bottom of this."`

			`The Auxiliary was swiftly destroyed, thanks to your masterful piloting. From your ship's sensor logs, you are able to pinpoint where the Alpha ship had launched from. It is another concrete bunker similar to the one Danforth destroyed, with a rudimentary landing pad and a hangar nearby. Peculiarly, your ship's scanner picks up no life forms in the bunker, no infrared signature or movement of any kind.`
			`	Fearing the landing pad being laced with explosives, you land on the grass field just beyond. As some of the robot workers converge to your position carrying specialised equipment, you prepare to enter this bunker as well. Another explosive charge later, the bunker lies open for you to enter.`
			`	You check the hangar first. A refuelling tube is abandoned in the corner, and a crew module for Navy Auxiliaries sits in the middle, held up by robotic arms. Then, after packing all the handheld scanners and weapons, you venture into the bunker with the robots.`
			`	The bunker is mostly empty, with no signs of struggle whatsoever. Chairs are arranged haphazardly, and drawers and cabinets are ajar, their contents missing. Behind a table, leaning against a wall and the ground, lies a few loose pieces of paper.  A blueprint of modifying Navy Auxiliaries is on the top, with arrows and comments pointing out what to alter. The subsequent pages are childish drawings of various Mereti and Sestor weapons, a Kar Ik Vot 349, and Jump Drives.`
			`	As you make way through the bunker's toilet and laundry rooms, you hear sounds. Peculiar whimperings and hissings you sometimes hear in Sestor and Efret worlds.`
			`	At the far corner of the bunker, a staircase leads downwards. The purpose of this dungeon is immediately obvious when you see the cages lined up neatly along the cuboid-shaped room. A total of ten cages are in this room, where nine Korath are imprisoned separately. The last cage, furthest from the door, is eerily empty. One of the Korath glances at you at the sound of you walking in, and lets out a frightened whimper. Instantly, all Korath disentangle themselves, and crouch in a submissive position.`

			`	The blast once again shakes the walls of the compound, and a hole appears. From the way the concrete cracks and sacks, it has yet to set completely. The wall was made only recently. What lies beyond, however, is truly breathtaking.`
			`	The area is a massive storage dump. Piles and piles of alien equipment are strewn across the floor, some clearly fallen over thanks to the blast. Human, Hai, and Korath stocks are prominently featured here, alongside rarer Wanderer creations. There are other equipment of distinctly different designs here as well. But what truly catches your eye, is one particular big pile at the end of the room. Covered beneath a large amount of Kor Mereti weapons lies a tarp fabric of a distinct Southern Mutual Defense Pact design, commonly seen in refugee camps in South Human Space. Egged on by the robots, you pick up the tarp, revealing the things beneath it.`
			`	Jump Drives. Ten of them.`
			`	Even the Sestor robots besides you stop their work, as their cameras are affixed towards the pile. After a short duration, they wheel around and ignore the equipment and start cataloguing the remaining piles.`
			`	And that is when you notice a peculiar equipment on the other side of the room. A small handheld device.`
			`	The device resembles, of all things, a pair of graviton ray transmitters and reflectors Freya used to restore the hyperlanes in human space. In fact, they seem to be the exact devices used to link Delta Capriconi and Markab. Syndicate security must be really lax, or the devices were ignored when the link was restored. Either way, this priceless piece of technology ended up in the hands of the Alpha, but no more.`
			`	Either way, with both parts of the bunker swept through, there is nothing else left unaccounted for.
