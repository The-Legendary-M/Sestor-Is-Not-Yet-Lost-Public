#Korath. Plural "Korath". Pronouns derived from "it"
#"Kor Sestor" refers to the pre-invasion Sestor state (when FL doesn't know about them other than "killing machines"). "Sestor Federation" refers to the one after.

#Unlike what the Wanderers and the Kor Efret predicted, the Sestor Federation, a nation that had been in a constant state of war for centuries, do not die off after a single sack of its capital. They survived countless Mereti attacks, and they would survive that single Alpha assault that lasted less than a month long. 
#The Sestor Federation did lose most of its ships and leadership in the attack. But like any competent government, backup plans exist. Currently, the Sestor Federation operates out of the bunker world of Sopi Lefarkata.

			`It has been a long time since the factories in Sestor Ikfar were shut down. With much fewer pollutants in the air, the ever-present smog over the planet has all but dissipated. You leave your ship, setting foot on the dusty concrete pad from which Kor Sestor drones used to take off and land. You can still see a few unrepaired drones in nearby hangars, all heavily damaged in battles years ago.`
			`	The spaceport is heavily damaged. A gigantic collapsed building is visible to the north,and the asphalt road leading to it is riddled with with scorch marks, bones, and barricades. The Sestor Korath here must have put up a fierce fight against the Alpha invasion.`
			`On the stretch of desert land near the hangars, two skeletons lie tangled against each other, a human one and a giant lizard skeleton you presume to be that of a Korath. You can only imagine the last moments of the Alpha fighter and the Sestor Korath, simultaneously striking killing blows against each other. The Korath's uniform lay torn and tattered, revealing a brightly-coloured metal plate. The plate's design is remarkably similar to a Republic ID card, with a photo of a Korath in the left, and short lines of symbols in the right. An ornate red logo lay near its top.`
			`	You pick up the plate. It must be a form of identification for this Sestor korath.`
			`Retrieving a shovel from your ship's cockpit, you untangle the two skeletons, and bury them where they lay. May the two rest in peace.`
			`	As you wander around the abandoned spaceport, you find a gigantic Kar Ik Vot 349 attached to a robotic tug in a secluded taxiway. Apparently, the tug was deactivated just before the warship was scheduled to launch. The Korath Exiles must have missed this ship as they looted this base.`
			`You climb up onto the tug, where an oval-shaped red LED button shone brightly in the shadows. Curious, you press the button. The button turns blue, as the tug begins to move. A faint whirr of the tug's motor signified its electric nature, as the tug tows the Kar Ik Vot 349 to a vacant launchpad next to your flagship. The tug stops, disconnects from the warship, and heads back towards the spaceport.`
			`Mindful of the ship's Kor Sestor origin, you climb up into the warship's interior. The door you blast open during space boarding, as it turns out, can be easily opened using the Sestor ID plate. A brief scan later, the Kar Ik Vot 349's main door opened.`
			`	You walk into the narrow corridor of the drone battleship. Just like the many times before where you captured a Sestor drone off-world, you replace the ship's IFF identification data with yours. The gigantic Sestor ship is yours.`

#Ikagalef? Derived from Megawati, the fourth Indonesian president, and the one name I feel Korath-like after the flip and letter replacement stuff.
#Yes, the exoskeleton thing is a Korath-Hai translator (very useful during Korath-Hai raids). Plugging it into a Hai-Human translator yields a Korath-Human translator. Due to both being designed for diplomatic use, the languages are made to be as polite as possible, hence the flowery tone.
#Korath use simple words and gestures to communicate. The exoskeleton translator picks up both to translate. Hence it's an exoskeleton.
#Feels like this mission is so long, but I like describing the environment. So mote it be.
#Korath seem to be neither male nor female. Using the pronouns it/it because I want to reserve they/them for groups of Korath to reduce confusion.
#For the story to work Ikgalef must be a competent, likeable person. Anybody else the Sestor is dead.

			`For a moment, you forget that this was once a Kor Sestor world. A scene straight out of New Austria, snowcapped mountains and boundless forests make up most of the landscape. Flying reptiles and birds can be seen swooping in the sky. Through your ship's inbuilt ground scanner, you can see slight disturbances from beneath the trees. Animals. The juxtaposition of this serene, calm world in a region of space ravaged by centuries of warfare is jarring.`
			`	The uneven terrain means that there are little places suitable for landing. Any flatlands that might have once existed are riddled with craters, no doubt the result of Mereti bombardments. Finally, you spot a clearing in a secluded valley, slightly larger than a Heavy Warship's size, and land your ship there.`
			`	As a precaution against native predators, you bring your shotgun with you as you disembark your ship. Before you can relax, you notice insects immediately trying to fly into your ship via the open door. You immediately close the door and activate your ship's environmental control system. The insects should be dealt with shortly. Other than the faint hissing sound from your ship winding down, there is no artificial noises.`
			`	The slightly yellow, waist-high grass and the faint noises of alien fauna is soothing and therapeutic, reminding you of your homeworld of New Boston. Which reminds you...`
			`	You rush back to your ship, and retrieve a loaf of New Boston farmhouse bread from the stasis chamber. With some cheese from New Holland, a can of baked beans from New Britain, and a piece of New Icelandic cod, you make your impromptu lunch. What more can a star pilot ask for, but a fulfilling meal made of the finest ingredients across the galaxy? You clear away some grass, lay down a small mat, and start eating. Mmmm, the grilled cheese smell amazing...`
			`	Just as you are about to finish your baked beans, you sense sudden movement out of your left eye. You turn towards the source, but nothing seems to be there. As you begin to pack away your food, you see the movement again. Picking up your rifle, you turn to investigate the source. Is it a predator stalking you? Better safe than sorry.`
			`	After a brief chase, you finally see a pale white leg vanishing just a second too late. You speed up to catch it, but then you suddenly lose your footing and fall to the ground, face-first. You turn around, only to stare down the barrel of a Korath Thermal Repeater rifle. You freeze, slowly putting your hands up.`
			`	The two Korath pointing their guns to you are not like the Kor Efret seen in Laki Nemparu. Large scars run down their foreheads and cheeks, and their bodies are shorter and wider. The two Korath shout frantically in a language you do not understand, and after a while, they stop.`
			choice
				`	(Stand still)`
					goto still
				`	"I come in peace!"`
			`Both Korath do not seem to understand your words, and, instead, the left one took out a picture from its breast pocket.`
				goto then
			
			label still
			`	After a protracted period of silence, the Korath on the left rummaged through its breast pocket before it produced a photograph.`
			
			label then
			`	The photograph depicts a crouching human in standard camouflage. His hairless face, ugly with bulging eyes, is contorted into a nasty snarl. And unlike you, this man has green skin.`
			`	"Alpha?" the Korath on your left asks, the first word you recognise. The other Korath visibly tenses.`
			`	"Human, human," you answer. Uttering a single "Alpha" might make them think you are one, and your reply is best kept simple.`
			`	"Humani," the right Korath turns towards the left one, "Humani, Alpha po'of."`
			`	The atmosphere visibly loosens slightly after this exchange, as the Korath takes on a friendlier tone. It appears that these Korath consider the Alpha enemies, and claiming that you are an enemy to the Alpha has lowered their suspicion somewhat. The impromptu interrogation happened a little longer, but not much else meaningful is exchanged between the three of you. Notable, however, is how fast the Korath are at snatching a few hair strands that happened to fall off you. You are creeped out, but are in no position to stop it.`
			`	The left Korath gestures to the right one, who grunts and beckons you to follow it as it turns and leaves. From the bushes all around your ship, tens of Korath emerge, and go into formation around you.`
			`	The Korath leads you out of the forest clearing, into the forest itself. `
			choice
				`(continue)`
			`The forest on Sopi Lefarkata is rather similar to that of New Tibet. Tall trees shrouded in mist, with the occasional bushes here or there. The Korath take great care to avoid small hills with holes in them, which you assume to be the den of some kind of animal. Right in front of you, a large beetle-like insect jumps up, and catches a small bird that was drinking nectar from a large, blue flower.`
			`	The Korath stop abruptly in front of a particularly large and bulbous tree. For a second, you worry whether the Korath are about to execute you. Fortunately, instead of shooting you, the Korath grabbed the thickest exposed tree root, and lift it up. The tree root turns out to be a disguise for a control panel, and a single press of an oval green button reveals a hidden doorway on the left that leads downwards. The Korath usher you into the doorway. A press of the oval red button in the doorway closes the opening.`
			`	The doorway beyond is brutalist, the greyish-colour of concrete occasionally defaced by what you assume to be the Korath language. The Korath usher you into a zone outlined in red, before one of them speak into a black rectangle. A gigantic automatic turret pop down from the ceiling, pointing at you, before retracting after the Korath mutter something more.`
			`	The door open to reveal a large cavern, much bigger than any you have ever seen. Thousands of buildings dot the hollowed-out area where Korath constantly stream in and out of. You can feel the heat emanating from lamps above and light tubes lining the walkways. Gigantic hangars are present, near what appears to be a launch platform facing a dark valley. Curiously, however, you see no ships launching or landing as expected from a settlement this large. Some mechanics are working on Far Lek 14's and Far Osk 29's, the only spacecraft visible here. Large greenhouses and algae tanks are visible, which probably provide the Korath food.`
			`	The Korath around you march you down to a giant bus-sized pod, which floats along metal roads towards a large building. In the building stands even more Korath with guns. Before long you find yourself facing the what appears to be the Korath's leader. The leader, sitting on a brown, leather chair, turns towards you. The two Korath guards steps back in unison, and march out. After a few, deafening seconds, the Korath leader speaks.`
			`	"Greetings, humani."`
			choice
				`	"Hello."`
				`	"How do you know my language?"`
					goto language
				`	"I come in peace!"`
			`"You are not Alpha," says the Korath leader, "Why are you here?"`
			`	"I was just exploring this region of space," you reply truthfully, "I though you were dead."`
			`	The Korath leader flares his nostril, as a loud snort rings your hears.`
			`	"Bah, those green kalabet do not kill all Korath. They do not know here. We do not have visitors. Why do you know us?"`
			`	"I was here before," you reply, "Your ships always shot at me."`
			`	"We do not know any ships other than the ke'epek Mereti. Only us and po'of fly here. We shoot everyone."`
			`	You feel an urge to tell the leader that their aggressive policy was what prevented visitors from coming. Antagonising the leader with many soldiers staring at you, however, is obviously unwise.`
			`	"How do you know my language?" You ask, dropping the matter entirely.`
			label language
			`	"The green kalabet, 'Alphas' they call themselves, land in Sestor Ikfar, our capital, and talk with us, saying they want to learn," the Korath leader says with disdain, "Lies, ralukut lies. Steal our ships and guns, kidnap Korath like livestock, and hold our leaders at gunpoint..."`
			`	The Korath leader starts to tremble, as his words increase in pitch, conviction, and speed, "Then they build a black ralukut. Defile our dance into their words. Despicable heresy! They do not know Sopi Lefarkata. We know them. We in Sopi Lefarkata learn Alpha tongue. We understand Alpha kalabet ralukut. We are not fooled. You are humani. Humani is Alpha po'of. You are good. You are rafeki."`
			`	The rant is evidently exhausting for the Korath leader, as he begins to visibly pant. These are Sestor Korath, who survived the Alpha attack. Needless to say, they are now sworn enemies of the Alpha.`
			`	"So, I am here merely to explore. I have no other intentions. I, like all humans, consider Alphas the enemy," you say, as you start to show the leader the same holograph videos you showed to the two guards.`
			`	The Sestor leader visibly frowns, and opens his mouth to answer. However, he is interrupted by his aide, who brings him a tablet alongside what is probably your hair they plucked earlier. On it a red symbol is present. Upon viewing, however, the leader visibly relaxes. A gesture later, all the soldiers guarding the hall did the same.`
			`	"You do not need to prove, humani. The Sestor trust you."`
			`	The Korath leader tilts his head, and taps his head before pushing his palm out to you. As you tilt your head in confusion, the Korath freezes, eyes going wide.`
			`	"Travellor," the Korath leader says, "I realise you do not know me. I am Ikgalef. President of the Sestor Federation."`
			`	"Captain <first> <last>, of New Boston," you reply in kind.`
			`	With most of the suspicion between you and Ikgalef gone, the conversation takes on a lighter tone. Ikgalef starts by recounting the history of the Sestor. The Sestor Federation is one of the many Korath nations, alternating between war and peace for the past few centuries. Unfortunately, dramatic escalation of warfare due to a revolution in what was the "Mereti Collective" led to a Korath-wide civil war, and the Sestor had been fighting non-stop for three centuries. Until the Mereti suddenly stop attacking the Sestor a short while ago, and a surprise Alpha raid on Sestor Ikfar. Fearing another attack, the Sestor went into hiding, enacting radio silence, grounding all their ships, and stopping all surface activities.`
			`	In return, you tell the Sestor leader about the whole situation about the Wanderers' struggle against the Unfettered Hai, their mission to terraform planets, the pacification of the Mereti drones, and how the stolen Sestor drone ordeal was resolved. Ikgalef visibly frown, but makes no comment.`
			`	Eventually, the interrogation-turned-amicable-discussion comes to an end. Ikgalef gives you a red tetrahedral pendant, a proof of non-hostility between you and the Sestor Korath, and and a provisional Sestor identity card.`
			`	"Rafeki, it is a pleasure to meet you, Captain," says Ikgalef, "Please do visit us sometime. We need an eye in the outside world."`
			`	With that, you are dismissed, and escorted out of the giant building.`
			choice
				`(Stay the night in this Sestor cavern)`
				`(Leave the city and spend the night in your ship)`
					goto shipnight
			`Being in a cave, the Sestor city does not have a natural way to show time. A giant clock on top of the central building displays time using a traditional clock face. It appears that clocks are rather universal throughout the Galaxy. To help with the perception of time, gigantic lamps on the cave's ceilings gradually dim as "nighttime" approaches.`
			`	Before it dismissed you, Ikgalef gave you a small card for your future stays in Sopi Lefarkata. Copying a Korath pedestrian, you scan the code representing the accomodation on a scanner installed in a street lamp. After a short while, a small portable hologram projector is activated, showing floating arrows and 3D models of buildings acting as a form of navigation. Retrieving the paper, you follow the navigator hologram's instructions for the night.`
			`	On wide, asphalt footpaths, Korath and robots walk along, with some shooting curious glances at you every now and then. You follow a path leading underground where many Korath are heading towards, which turns out to be a train station. Metro rides are apparently free here, and you board a train that heads towards the city center.`
			`	The train ride is smooth and quiet, just as expected of a modern maglev system. A few Korath sitting on the seats can be seen reading newspapers, with the same script you saw on the entrance's concrete walls. Two Korath sit across each other, staring at what seems to be Korath chess. Being the sole human in this Korath cave earns you many, many looks, and you do your best to ignore this.`
			`	You leave the train where most of the passengers do as well. The city centre here on Sopi Lefarkata reminds you of the Earth cities of New York and Hong Kong, where buildings are dense and tall, people walk quickly and look down, and shops are ubiquitous.`
			`	You find a restaurant along the path where with a long Korath queue and wait. It is fortunate that helpful photos are provided alongside written names to the few dishes served there. You decide to follow the vast majority of Korath, and choose a bowl of fish soup.`
			`	Ordering the fish soup is the right call. The subtle flavour of algae complements the vague sweetness of fish very well, and the various pieces of tube vegetables in it provide it with something to chew. The soup is as delicious as it is filling, and you leave the shop satisfied.`
			`	Apparently the accommodation you are staying at is the only one in Sopi Lefarkata, being a highly militarised planet. You return your holograph navigator by placing it on a silver area (the platform sinks, returning it to circulation), and use your Sestor card on an automatic counter to check in.`
			`	The room you have has windows that overlook the city. Alongside the usual sonic shower and laundry machine always seen in a human hotel, you discover that this room's temperature control settings has a much greater range, and has an option to set temperature variations over time.`
			`	After a thorough sonar cleansing of your body, your clothes, the pillows and the towels provided, you quickly fall asleep. It has been a stressful day.`
			choice
				`(continue)`
			`	The next day, after a quick breakfast (a simple porridge-like grain stew) you take the Korath metro to the spaceport. During the interrogation the day before, the Sestor towed your ship into the spaceport, and did a thorough scanning. The spaceport itself is empty, because of the Sestor ships all being drones, and that Sestor ships had been grounded after the Alpha attack. A full body scan reveals no anomalies, and your ship is fully spaceworthy.`
				goto final
			label shipnight
			`Spending the night amongst the Korath seem to be too much of a hassle, especially due to the language barrier. Despite Ikgalef giving you a card that has codes to access the most important places in Sopi Lefarkata, you decide that the familiar sleeping quarters in your ship is a better idea.`
			`	During your interrogation, the Korath had moved your ship from the grass field into the cave's spaceport for investigation. They found nothing threatening, as they should. This does mean that your ship is now in the Sopi Lefarkata spaceport, though, and you decide to reclaim your ship by travelling there.`
			`	The card Ikgalef gave you is easy to use. Scanning the "spaceport" code in a scanner activates a holographic navigator, which uses symbols to guide you to where you need to go. This time, the navigator points you to the city's metro system, and you board a maglev train going towards the city periphery. It is evening now, and many Korath board the same train as you as they travel from their workplaces in the city centre back to their homes. Despite the crowded train, you smell no body odour like you usually do in human or Hai cities, for the reptilian Korath produce no sweat.`
			`	Being the only human in this Korath city spares you many, many glances, and you do your best to ignore them. Screens on carriage sides show a Korath news presenter reporting about the Korath news today, and you are very surprised to see your arrival and your ship being shown on-screen. Faces turn towards you, and you grin sheepishly and do a little wave to them. The camera cuts to a confused reporter waiting outside the building you left a while ago. You realise that you have been very lucky to evade the Korath media and the embarrassment that the language barrier would ensure. The sniggers die down to attentive gazes as the news program gives way to a Korath boxing match, and you soon leave the train.`
			`	You see your ship parked on the sole occupied tarmac, near the draped opening where spaceships presumably enter and exit from. With Sestor drones being grounded, there is virtually no activity in the spaceport. Several autonomous robot vehicles are refuelling your ship, as per standard procedure. You enter your ship and immediately take a sonic shower. While not nearly as relaxing as a hot water shower, sonic showers give your sore muscles a subtle massage, which helps a lot, especially after standing for a whole day.`
			`	You make yourself a small sandwich, and quickly fall asleep. The next day, you do a full scan of your ship, receiving an "all normal" sign. Your ship is ready for takeoff.`
			label final
			`	The spaceport is fully sealed from the outside, and to take off, the gigantic port doors must open. Fortunately, a piece of card left behind by the Korath investigators give you a small device that can toggle the doors.`
			`	You are now able to enter and leave Sopi Lefarkata as you please.`

			`Choosing a landing area is surprisingly easy, the former spaceport on Sestor Ikfar still being a prominent landmark even after the destructive Alpha invasion. After you land your ship on one of the less-damaged landing pads, you allow the five-Korath expedition to wander around.`
			`	You can already see the sorry state of the spaceport from afar. Up close, however, the damage seems more serious. Everything is in ruins. All hangars around you are either collapsed, or their doors visibly torn. The landing pads and access roads are heavily cratered by bombs, and the control tower is cleanly cut in half. Dead soldiers, both Alpha and Korath, have long since decayed, but the skeletons are still recognisable.`
			`	The hangars with missing doors have been almost completely looted. Presumably, they once housed intact and functional Sestor drones that were taken by the Alphas and the Korath Exiles. Instead, the five Korath head towards the collapsed hangars and buildings, and begin searching for them.`
			`	To your surprise, Robot tugs and other ground service vehicles have mostly survived the cataclysm. The building that housed them was struck by a missile and burnt (the impact craters and scorch marks have but a simple explanation), but the internal fire-proof systems of both the building and the vehicles themselves saved them from being destroyed. The Alphas and the Exiles never had the time to investigate.`
			`	The robotic vehicles proved to be of great help for the excavations the five Korath want to do. What was originally a simple scouting and scavenging mission becomes a full retrieval mission, as the Korath and the robots heisted tonnes of slightly damaged machines and other kinds of equipment onto your ship.`
			`	While you were busy cataloguing the various pieces of industrial equipment, you notice a few Korath discreetly slipping away into another room. Not wanting to create conflicts with your newly-met friends, you decided to not interfere. Anyway, their reason of disappearance becomes obvious a few minutes later, as they lift a bundle into their bunks. When asked, they simply stated that the bundle is an important artefact.`
			`	With the machines all secured in the cargo bay, the Korath then request you to land near a secluded factory complex on the other side of the planet.`
			`	You expect more ruins and empty space in the factory, after all the Alpha and the Exiles looted basically everything from Sestor Ikfar. Yet, the factory seem untouched. In front of you is a Met Par Tek 53 with its red protective armour missing. On the sides lie the protective armour. On the left, the keel of a Tek Far 109 is lain, waiting for the intricate components to be installed. Gigantic robot arms are arranged in neat columns and rows, handling a myriad of tools you can only guess the functions of. The factory is turned off, and everything is still. Maybe you should visit a Sestor factory in the future. Robots are cool. This factory must have been missed by the scouring Alphas and Exiles.`
			`	The Korath photograph the factory's state, before heading to the factory's control room. A few minutes later, and holding a kite-shaped crystal, they return to your ship. The expedition is over, and you prepare to head back to Sopi Lefarkata.`

Compared to crashing asteroids down, as it was done for centuries, towing them down using sublight drones has proven to increase production levels by over 500%.`

Huge, 3000mm-gauged railways haul hundreds of thousands tonnes of metal ores from asteroids to refineries, where they would be processed and shipped off-world to construct various machinery.`

		spaceport `Keneska Fek's spaceport is remarkably simple, with rows of landing pads leading directly to the entrance. The access roads are wide and made of reinforced concrete, enabling gigantic vehicles to haul gigantic blocks of metals directly to departing freighters.`

			`Once again, you see the familiar face of Ikgalef meeting you as you step out from your ship. Unlike most other times, however, there is no mission this time. Instead, Ikgalef invites you to a dinner in one of Sopi Lefarkata's most exquisite restaurants.`
			`	Fine dining is a rarity for you. As a starship captain, most meals you have are either simple sandwiches you make in your ship, quick pasta dishes you cook in your ship's rudimentary kitchen, or cheap meals you eat in local restaurants or spaceport cafeterias. The celebration meal you had with your parents when you graduated with flying colours in your elementary school back in New Boston was one such instance. Apart from that, only the occasional state meals you had with the leadership of the Free Worlds comes to mind.`
			`	Korath fine dining is rather different from human fine dining. Hardly ever do you see wrestling rings or gun ranges in formal human restaurants. You also fail to remember the presence of giant billboards that allow you to post scribbled stickies on.`
			`	Seeing your shocked look, Ikgalef chuckles.`
			`	"Why are you so shocked? Fine dining should be fun! Nothing heals stressed-out Korath more than a few punches and a few drawings of your own!"`
			`	It seems that the Korath idea of a "fine" dining is rather different from what humans consider one to be.`
			`	Ikgalef and you sit down on a table a little distance away from the wrestling ring. "Better, viewing from distance," claims Ikgalef. As Ikgalef converses with the waiter what it wants, you look at the menu. Amongst the familiar images of fish steak, salad, stews and baked dishes, you see a soup bowl with weird, grey balls. Feeling adventurous, you point at that to the waiter, successfully ordering your dish non-verbally.`
			`	In the wrestling ring, two Korath are engaged in a fierce boxing match. While the punches are fierce, you can see that both are acting with great restraint. Then, astonishingly, before first blood is drawn, the Korath visibly in a disadvantage surrender, a rather disappointing end for you. Before you can ponder any more, your dish arrives.`
			`	The dish up close looks more appetising than the one in photos, although that's not a high bar to cross. Within the grey blobs you can see little pieces of yellow-white reflective tissue. You poke at it with your fork, discovering that the savoury blob is strangely elastic and "bouncy" in a way. The milky-white soup has a hint of sweetness within its umami flavour. The food is brilliant. Sestor cuisine is exquisite.`
			`	"Blended fish," introduces Ikgalef, shoving a piece of fish into his mouth, "It's made of all the parts in a bony fish blended together."`
			` 	You choke. Sometimes it's best not to ponder about the origin of food.`
			`	Just like that, you banter with Ikgalef as you both enjoy your meals in the rowdy establishment. The topics drift quickly, going from talking about human and Korath foods (No, Ikgalef, shrimp shells are not eaten), to sport events ("How is football a sport without fighting?" shouted Ikgalef), to space combat experience (You are better with tactics, commanding a fleet in many battles, while Ikgalef is better with strategies, having constantly fought against the Mereti), and finally to the Wanderers.`
			`	"You mention about the Wanderers pacifying the Mereti. Where do they base themselves in, anyway?" asked Ikgalef.`
			`	"Hmm? Their first colony around here is in Spera Anatrusk, but they base themselves in Desi Seledrak now," you reply. After all, knowing thy neighbours is a good way forward.`
			`	Ikgalef raises his eyebrows, and continued.`
			`	"They are terraformers, right? How long are they staying?"`
			`	"Oh, around 10,000 years last I heard. They are handing them over to the Kor Efret way in the west."`
			`	Ikgalef freezes, his fork dropping dramatically onto the plate, impaling his fish fillet right in the middle. His eyes widens, as a feather falls from his head.`
			`	"What? No!" Ikgalef seems to have lost its appetite in an instant.`
			`	Confused, you try to console Ikgalef about this sudden outburst, but before you say anything Ikgalef seems to have calmed himself.`
			`	"Pi'at Afilek, Captain," said Ikgalef, its tone turning steely, "We must move quickly."`
			`	"Why the distress?"`
			`	Ikgalef turns to you, expression darkening, "The Efreti are blood traitors. They are born Korath, yet they act shamelessly and traitorously like the Hai. They cower behind the Quarg like slaves. They are as spineless as their muscles are massless. They represent everything a Korath is not. To give them Anatruskor territory is blasphemy. This is as outrageous. It is unfair. This must not happen. Be'oof..."`
			`	Ikgalef rants with an unbridled rage against the Hai and the Kor Efret, quickly slipping back into his native Sestor tongue as he shouts his throat hoarse.`
			`	"They're not that bad, Ikgalef. The Hai are peaceful traders who provide humans a safe haven. The Efreti welcomes outsiders like me, and have been cooperating peacefully with the Wand-"`
			`	"The Hai betrayed us when we needed them the most!" roars Ikgalef, "And don't you dare defend the Efreti, they bow to whoever they think is stronger than them, which is anything not Korath! The moment you show weakness they stab you in the back"`
			`	From Ikgalef's flushed and angry face and wild gestures, you can feel Ikgalef really, really loath the two alien factions.`
			`	"Please, Rafeki Captain <last>, you must understand the heinous things the Efreti have done. They do not deserve, and do not fit, to live in Anatruskor land. 10,000 years? That's forever! The Wanderers are tricking everyone else! Rafeki Captain, everyone else in this space are crooks! We must strengthen ourselves quickly!"`
			`	Ikgalef is in an emotional state, and you know reasoning with it is bound to fail. You give a non-committal assent, which Ikgalef elatedly interprets as a full-on support. With that out of the way, you continue your meal.`
			`	The conversation about the Wanderers, unfortunately, have ruined the mood. You both finish your meals quickly, foot the bill, and leave the restaurant.`
			`	You return to your ship, troubled by Ikgalef's outburst and the animosity between the Efreti and Wanderers, and the Sestor.`

			`Ikgalef being present while you land is now a routine rather than a surprise. Today's landing is no different, with you waving to the familiar silhouette of the Sestor President, hoping for a friendlier, less tense conversation.`
			`	To your surprise, Ikgalef is not giving you a job today. Instead, wearing a translator, he points at the many, many Sestor automata that lines the spaceport. Somehow, you have missed them, probably too focused on manoeuvring your ship through the tight gap of Sopi Lefarkata's spaceport.`
			`	"Rafeki! Today is a great day, for the Sestor territory is whole again. Pi'at Afilek for your service for us, and we owe you a lot! Please, Rafeki Captain, join me as we watch the first Sestor automaton fleets leave their base!"`
			`	As if on command, on your left, a gigantic Tek Far 109 filled with FO-29 fighters and FL-14 drones lifts off from the ground, engines whirring. It quickly joins the rapidly moving line of Sestor warships leaving the spaceport, racing towards the sky.`
			`	"Isn't this marvellous, Rafeki? After the fiendish, dishonourable Alpha ralukut sacked our capital, the grand fleet of the True Korath rules the cosmos once again! With an upgraded control system and more vigorous defensive installments, we shall never be brought down again!"`
			`	With the ship launch sequence completed, Ikgalef invites you to a pavilion in the centre of a park. You both sit down, and Ikgalef produces two bottles of reddish-yellow liquid from its bag.`
			`	"Have a drink, my Rafeki!" Ikgalef finishes, handing you one of the bottles.`
			`	Feeling positive and adventurous, you decide to open the bottle, and drink the thick liquid within. To your surprise, it is not alcoholic. The drink is sweet, with a slight sour tone to it, reminding you of the Caipririnha you always order in bars back on Earth. Surprisingly, the drink causes a pleasant tingling sensation throughout your mouth, eventually numbing it. You mentally remind yourself of buying some when you have the chance.`
			`	"True Korath?" you ask.`
			`	"Yes, us, True Korath! Those who never bend their knees, those who welcome everyone with open arms, those who fight for freedom and justice, the True Korath!"`
			`	Ikgalef's expression then turned soft and sighed, "When the Archons come, they give us ultimatum. Join the Efreti traitors, or leave on an exile. We choose third option, to stay here, but the Archons demanded our brightest and smartest to go. They never come back."`
			`	"You mean the Korath Exiles?" you ask.`
			`	"Yes, you hear of them? In stories and legends, I guess," Ikgalef replies, "Like us, they do not submit. Like us, they choose freedom, the hard way. They are also True Korath. Maybe they are still out there, maybe they die by the Archons the moment they jump... At least they die for honour, unlike the cowardly Efreti traitors who bow and submit to the Quarg like slaves!"`
			`	By the end of the sentence, Ikgalef is sporting a ferocious snarl. He sighs, "I guess we do not wallow in the past. At least the True Korath rises again-"`
			`	"The Korath Exiles still exist," you interrupt.`
			`	Ikgalef turns sharply towards you.`
			`	"East of the human core worlds, south from here," you continue, "there exists a cluster of systems where a group of Korath resides. They live in stations, and occasionally raid us humans for resources."`
			`	"What else do you know about them?"`
			`	"The Wanderers contacted them to shut down your factories," you say, "and they took some of your schematics along with some of the Mereti's."`
			`	Ikgalef falls silent for a long, long while. Eventually, it speaks.`
			`	"May you meet me at the spaceport later? I have job for you."`

			`Ikgalef is already in the spaceport by the time you finish your errands.`
			`	"Thank you for your understanding, and sorry for the suddenness of the job."`
			`	The existence of the Korath Exiles is apparently news to Ikgalef and the Sestor Korath. Like-minded, Ikgalef immediately wishes to seek alliance with the Exiles. Like last time with the Wanderers, you are to land on Far'en Lai.`
			`	"The Exiles are hostile to all human ships, including mine."`
			`	"Worry not, Rafeki. I make sure they do not."`
			`	You nod, and Ikgalef begins to walk to your ship, accompanied by four bodyguards. You see several robot workers transferring refrigerated containers of some sort into your ship, but you say nothing.`

			`Ever since the Exile stealing drone technology, they have become hostile to you once again. You are nervous that the Exile will attack you on sight. When Ikgalef talks to them over the communications channel, the attacks stop.`
			`	Without further incidents, you land on Far'en Lai, closely followed by a Tubfalet you see undocking from Safaresk Enlai just as you initiate the landing sequence.`
			`	You walk out of your ship, followed closely by Ikgalef. A group of Korath Exiles exit their ship.`
			`	For a moment, neither group of the Korath moves. Then, Ikgalef begins to utter what seems to be an inquiry. The Korath Exile scratches his feathers, seemingly not understanding what Ikgalef was saying. Two more Korath Exiles walk out of the Exile raiding vessel, and approach Ikgalef. The older one hesitantly and rigidly makes some dance moves, clearly not too accustomed. When Ikgalef returns the dance in graititude, the two laugh and embrace each other.`
			`	You stand aside, looking at the Korath gesturing wildly and making all kinds of weird noises. All things considered, Far'en Lai is a pretty ordinary, undeveloped world, not so different from the many sparsely-settled worlds all over human space. The only difference is the sky still being rather bright even late in the evening. One strange quirk of core planets, you suppose.`
			`	Ikgalef occasionally gestures towards you while talking to the Exile elder. You walk towards them, and a Korath gives a white octahedron to you. "It is a safe pass," explains Ikgalef, "Show this through hologram every time you enter Exile space, and they will not harm you."`
			`	"We have a lot to do, Rafeki Captain." says Ikgalef, barely hiding his joy.`
			`	Some of the Korath talk into a device, and a Rano'erek soon lands near you. Yet more Korath step out, hauling large, refrigerated crates. They bring the boxes in front of Ikgalef, and lift the cover. To your utmost surprise, of all things these crates are filled with shed Korath skin. The whitish, transparent scales are folded neatly in stacks, and are labelled in characters vaguely resembling those you saw on Sestor Ikfar and Sopi Lefarkata.`
			`	Seeing this, Ikgalef motions to its bodyguards, and remove the frozen containers from your ship as well. When they open it, once again it's Korath skin. `
			`	As you stare dumbfounded at this exchange of peculiar goods, Ikgalef asks you permission to load the Exile skin into your cargo hold. "Sure," you affirmk, brain still not processing this exotic good.`
			`	With everything set and done, Ikgalef clears you to return to Sopi Lefarkata.`

			`During the journey back, you cannot help but ask Ikgalef what the frozen Korath skin is used for.`
			`	"Memories," answers Ikgalef, "Korath store memories in skin. Korath share memories by eating Korath skin. Sestor exchange skin with Exiles as a symbol of bond."`
			`	You stare at Ikgalef, not processing whatever it said. Ikgalef shows you a video of young Korath eating the skin of older ones, and Korath eating skin from each other. It is a morbid but fascinating sight.`
			`	Korath education must be short and quick, you think. Plans to pick up some Korath language textbooks are now impossible.`
			`	Eventually, your ship approaches Sopi Lefarkata and begins its landing sequence. Ikgalef hands you a credit chip worth 100,000 credits and thanks you for your ride.`
			`	"Exiles, Sestor Rafeki, as it should," said Ikgalef, "True Korath is stronger than ever!"`
			`	You cannot shake the feeling that the skin means more than just symbols, but you know it's not time to dwell on that. You bid each other farewell, and go your separate ways.`

			`While you have seen many Korath Exile ships up close, in escort missions and in the battlefield, you have never approached a Korath Exile station this close, much less dock with one.`
			`	Compared to other stations you saw in human and Hai space, and even Sasirka Gatru, Safaresk Enlai is far larger. The largest dock bays can easily fit two Bactrians and two Navy Carriers in the same place without any problems. In addition to these internal dock bays, you can also see external docking clamps, presumably for the large Korsmanath A'awojs that cannot fit in even these hangars.`
			`	You show the white octahedron to the Korath Exile docking officer, who directs you to one of the smaller dockyards. You step out of the ship alongside Ikgalef, and are promptly led to a meeting room.`
			`	You are once again reminded of the many, many times waiting in line of a Sestor shop, surrounded by Korath who speaks languages you don't understand. Ikgalef and his Exile counterparts chat for a long while, dancing vigorously in the middle of the meeting room, as the Korath guards watch intently. Phrases like "Alpha" and "Anatruskor" are frequently mentioned, and the Exile leader occasionally lets out lamenting moans. You, on the other hand, mostly focuses on the cup of Korath algae soup you are given, trying hard not to be bored.`
			`	The pleasant discussion, however, slowly turns less amicable. The Exile leader suddenly seems enraged at certain words Ikgalef said, and is shouting in anger. It doesn't look like an argument, however, as Ikgalef isn't shouting back. Rather, the Sestor president seems focussed on calming the enraged Korath Leader down.`
			`	"Be'oof! Kalabet! Ralukut Alajfenreb!" The Exile leader shouts, reminding you of the many colourful curses Sestor commuters threw once, when the train line towards the city centre broke down.`
			`	After a long, long session of consoling, the Exile leader finally calms down.`
			`	After the outburst, the two Korath leaders seem to turn into other topics at hand. Once again, Ikgalef gestures towards you, referring to you as "Rafeki Humanika", and seem to gesture positively about you and your deeds.`
			`	"Rafeki... Humanika?" The Exile leader seem to have just noticed your existence.`
			`	"Captain <first> <last>," you answer tactfully, "Human."`
			`	Unfortunately, the sight of you and your ship, visible in the docking bay, seems to have triggered the Exile leader. Once again, the Exile leader flies into a prolonged rant, this time sneaking angry looks in your direction, no doubt speaking against you.`
			`	"Karaiptnreb! Ranrivah!" As more and more colourful Korath insult are thrown your way, you decide glance around the room.`
			`	The Exile conference room is surprisingly small, with no conference tables of sort. Instead, Korath cluster around a half-circle, centred around Ikgalef and the Exile leader, dance-arguing vividly over what appears to be your allegiance. Guards are understandably tense, no doubt preparing to subdue you at a moment's notice. However, no such order comes.`
			`	Ikgalef motions you over, and you comply, maintaining distance from the fuming Exile leader.`
			`	The Sestor President sighs, as the Exile leader turns to you, looking fiercely.`
			`	"This is Ruiko'ar, Navarch of the Exiles.  Very skeptical of your alignment. Tell me, do you work for those 'Wanderers' you speak of?"`
			`	"Yes," you nod. Denying now would only lead to so many more problems later on.`
			`	"Do you open the wormhole, the 'Eye' you call it?"`
			`	"No," you deny, "The Pug did it."`
			`	"Do you lead the Eye to our space?"`
			`	"No. I had no control over it."`
			`	With that, Ikgalef turns back towards the Exile leader.`
			`	"Nrupuhfeb! Arip!" Ruiko'ar roars, her grip on the long, wooden cane growing stronger and trembling harder.`
			`	Ikgalef puts his hand on his forehead, ruffling his feathers there, in an almost facepalm gesture. He dances with the Ruiko'ar for a while longer. Finally, after ten more minutes of bickering and arguing, Ruiko'ar relents.`
			`	"Ruiko'ar, opinionated Korath," Ikgalef says, "Think you betray Korath by directing the Eye here. You have no control of wormholes, I know. I convince her you do no wrong."`
			`	The Exiles seem very very opposed to the fact that Wanderers are setting up shop in Korath space.`
			`	"Come, Rafeki Captain, we have much to do," says the Sestor President, as he pockets a small piece of memo Ruiko'ar gave him in his shirt.`
			`	Without any further incidents happening, the Exile visit stays mostly uneventful. Exile algae soup is far less appetising than Sestor soup, but it is far more filling. Another necessity for a group living off space stations, you suppose.`
			`	The next day, Ikgalef and you prepare to depart from the station, returning to Sopi Lefarkata.`

			`Ikgalef leads you into his office after you land back on the bunker city. "The Galaxy changes," says the Sestor President, "We must stay strong to stay on top."`
			`	"Give me some time to think," Ikgalef continues, as he brings out stacks of files, "Situation is far more complicated than I think."`
			`	You cannot help but feel slightly unsettled by the Exiles' opposition to the Wanderers. With Ikgalef's position unknown, you dare not voice this thoughts to him. Maybe a visit to Wanderer space is a better option.`

			`Slowly, you land on the concrete pad you did while accompanying Admiral Danforth. The Navy collapsed the entire limestone cave system, causing much dirt to cascade down the entrance. Fern trees have begun to grow on it, and the surface looks like just another hill side.`
			`	The Sestor Korath leave your ship, accompanied by their robot surveyors. After a brief scan, massive crane machines are unpacked, and start excavating the entrance. Before long, a ruined entrance appears, and you enter the Alpha base with your Korath and robot companions.`
			`	Most corridors in the base is swiped clean, no doubt the handiwork of the fleeing Alpha and the raiding Republic Navy soldiers. Much of the base is collapsed. You are sure the base is larger, but the efforts of the fleeing Alpha must have destroyed the base so thoroughly that none may enter.`
			`	Then, one of the robots blows up one of the walls, and the real base appears. Beyond the exploded wall you find find... Nothing. You see ten metal cages with a lizard head sign hanging over the doors, and a door far away, ajar. Beyond the door lies a few scrap pieces of metal. That is it.`
			`	Suddenly, you hear an emergency beep coming from your personal digital assistant. Your ship detects another ship leaving the atmosphere. For all you know, they can be Alphas. Unwilling to risk the occupants escaping, you head back to your ship, ready to intercept the escapees.`

			`Your Korath passengers are shocked and saddened to see Sestor drones attacking you, and their subsequent destruction. With great care, however, you manage to destroy the Auxiliary.`
			`	From your ship's sensor logs, you are able to pinpoint where the Alpha ship had launched from. It is another concrete bunker similar to the one Danforth destroyed, with a rudimentary landing pad and a hangar nearby. Peculiarly, your ship's scanner picks up no life forms in the bunker, no infrared signature or movement of any kind.`
			`	Fearing the landing pad being laced with explosives, you land on the grass field just beyond. Weapons out, you and your Korath passengers step out of your ship, deploying the robots and heavy machinery. Surprisingly, when you approach the complex the doors to the hangars and the bunker open automatically.`
			`	You check the hangar first. A refuelling tube is abandoned in the corner, and a crew module for Navy Auxiliaries sits in the middle, held up by robotic arms. Then, after packing all the handheld scanners and weapons, you venture into the bunker with the Korath surveyors and the robots.`
			`	The bunker is mostly empty, with no signs of struggle whatsoever. Chairs are arranged haphazardly, and drawers and cabinets are ajar, their contents missing. Behind a table, you find a stack of paper.  A blueprint of modifying Navy Auxiliaries is on the top, with arrows and comments pointing out what to alter. The subsequent pages are childish drawings of various Mereti and Sestor weapons, a Kar Ik Vot 349, and Jump Drives. They are not important, so you leave them in the bunker.`
			`	As you make way through the bunker's toilet and laundry rooms, you hear sounds. Peculiar whimperings and hissings you sometimes hear in Sestor and Efret worlds. Curious, you go to investigate the noises.`
			`	You are surprised to find nine Korath imprisoned in this place, huddled together and shivering. One of them glances at you at the sound of you walking in, and lets out a frightened whimper. Instantly, all Korath disentangle themselves, and crouch in a submissive position.`
			`	The locks are simple, but unreachable from inside the cages. Using a hairpin, you pick the lock, and let the Korath inside out. Just as they are walking out, your Korath companions run into the room. After a little bit of hissing and yelping, your Korath companion turns to you, and gestures towards the Korath prisoners and to your ship. It appears they want a ride back to Korath space. You accept.`
			`	So far, this bunker's layout is identical to the empty one you were exploring earlier. You push through the embracing Korath, into the room beyond.`
			`	Ten Jump Drives are piled neatly along the back of the room. You make a mental note to carry them in your ship. Jump Drives are valuable after all. However, a computer terminal on your left catches your eye.`
			`	The device resembles, of all things, a pair of graviton ray transmitters and reflectors Freya used to restore the hyperlanes in human space. In fact, they seem to be the exact devices used to link Delta Capriconi and Markab. Syndicate security must be really lax, or the devices were ignored when the link was restored. Either way, this priceless piece of technology is in the hands of the Alpha, but no more.`
			`	You have a sudden thought. What if there was once a hyperlane between Host and Ferukistek? By putting the reflector on Avalon and the transmitter on Keneska Fek, a hyperlane might be able to be established between the two systems. With that, you pick up the ten Jump Drives and the hyperspace relay kit, and make your way back to your ship.`
			`	The Auxiliary's appearance has interfered with the schedule somewhat. You decide to leave a few robot workers on this planet, to both establish a full-blown Sestor base, and to detect any further Alpha signatures.`
			`	Carefully, you place the reflector on the unoccupied landing pad. You wave the Korath, signalling it's time for departure. Securing the ten Jump Drives in your cargo hold, you take off.`

			`	You nod in agreement. Just then, your Korath passengers disembark from your ship. Ikgalef waves at them, then freezes when the eleventh Korath leaves the ship.`
			`	Ikgalef walks to the nineteen Korath, body slightly trembling. You are surprised to hear a low growl after several minutes of Korath mumbles. Ikgalef's face is clouded with anger, its brows furrowed and its fists shaking. Ikgalef walks towards you, and opens its mouth.`
			`	"Thank you, Captain, for saving these nine poor souls. The Alpha is a threat to all Korath-kind, and must be stopped at all costs. I will arrange a military expedition soon. Please wait for me at the spaceport soon."`
			`	Ikgalef must be very angry that its drops its ever politeness. Because of your friendship with Ikgalef and your hatred towards the Alpha, you decide to accept the mission. Content, Ikgalef walks off, organising its soldiers.`

			`	The Korath soldiers file out, weapons in hand. The tanks behind them slowly roll out of the ship hangar, cannons primed to fire. No enemies appear, however.`

Construction robots begin to clean the existing facilities, while building greenhouses and water purification plants for its future Korath inhabitants to use. Several local reptiles wander close, curious, but are completely ignored by the working robots.`

			`The mining industry on Keneska Fek is mostly automatic, with drones gliding over the ground carrying ores everywhere.
