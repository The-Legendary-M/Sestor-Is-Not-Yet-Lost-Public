#Sestor capital ship. Kinda strays into Superheavy category. A very powerful ship that gives the Heliarch, and even the Quarg, a run for its money.

	description "Originally developed by the Sestor Federation to single-handedly destroy entire Efreti-Korsmanathi and Mereti fleets, the Tek Ot Rah 681 was never completed when the Archons intervened. With the restoration of peace and resumption of trade within and without Korath Space, the Sestor have finally completed the development of this massive ship."
	description "  The Tek Ot Rah 681 is the pinnacle of Korath ship building. Four gun ports and sixteen turret points are well-complemented by the ship's massive outfit and weapon spaces. Ample engine space allow the Tek Ot Rah to pursue larger fleeing enemies with ease, which are common sights when one such warship is encountered in the battlefield."
	description "  Rumours have it that a new type of engines were being developed specifically for this ship, but ultimately they were never completed."
