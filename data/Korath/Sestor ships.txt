	description `Centuries ago, the emergence of the Scatter Mine means that a small Mereti squadron could defeat a massive Sestor fighter swarm with ease. To remedy this, the Sestor created the Met Par Tek 41 to combat this problem. Equipped with a Warder Anti-Missile, the MPT-41 would jump into the battlefield, clear the mines around it, before accompanying Sestor carriers would deploy their fighters.`
	description `	However, tts impact on the battlefield would be quickly proven to be limited, as the low shield and hull integrity of the MPT-41 means that the Mereti could destroy the minesweeping ship quickly before the Warder could clear much of the minefields. When its successor, the Met Par Tek 53, entered production, the MPT-41 was quickly taken out of service.`
	description `	The comparably low mass and high speed of the SL-41 design, however, would later prove to be key in future developments, as their designers would use it as a base to develop the next generation of Sestor parasite spacecraft, the FL-14 and FS-27, both of which still remain heavily in use in the Sestor navy up to this day.`

	description `With the Mereti "wolf pack" tactic of using massed Model 16s to outgun and outlast Sestor warships proven to be successful, the Sestor military is pressured to develop a countermeasure. The Met Ik Par 43 is developed as a counter to it.`
	description `	Sporting six gun ports, all equipped with Thermal Repeaters, the Met Ik Par 43 designed specifically to duel Model 16s and come out victorious. These ships would prove to be popular, widely deployed in most Sestor fleets.`

	description `While the combination of the Korath Detainer, the Banisher Grav-Turret, and the Grab-Strike Turret have been proven to be very effective against lone Mereti ships, Sestor ships often lack long-ranged firepower to finish them off before enemy reinforcements could arrive.`
	description `	Utilising four Piercer Missile Launchers and two Banisher turrets, the Nak Par Tek 103 is designed to fulfil this niche, assisting allies in holding an adversarial warship in place, while using its four Piercer Missile Launchers to deal massive amounts of damage to it.`



##Insane superheavy. A very powerful ship that gives the Heliarch, and even the Quarg, a run for its money.

	description `Originally developed by the Sestor Federation to single-handedly destroy entire Efreti-Korsmanathi and Mereti fleets, the Tek Ot Rah 681 was never completed when the Archons intervened. With the restoration of peace and resumption of trade within and without Korath Space, the Sestor have finally completed the development of this massive ship.`
	description `	The Tek Ot Rah 681 is the pinnacle of Korath ship building. Four gun ports and sixteen turret points are well-complemented by the ship's massive outfit and weapon spaces. Four installed Korath Detainers allow the Tek Ot Rah to pursue larger fleeing enemies with ease, which are common sights when one such warship is encountered in the battlefield.`
