#The Kor Efret are not happy after knowing that the Sestor, their mortal enemy, survived.
#Currently, their main goal is to sway the Wanderers into handing over terraformed Korath planets to them.
#Secondary goal is to militarise and defeat the Sestor.


#Like the Sestor, the Efret wants to expand, now that the automaton threat is gone(?)
#The thing is, unlike the Anatruskor, there are quite a few planets that are liveable straight away, needing no terraformation.

#They are the Kor Efret, or the Efreti Korath. Their stuff is Efret stuff. 

#Calm before the storm. Escorting Efreti Korath between Wanderer worlds and Efreti worlds.

			`	After your daring rescue of the Charm-Shallop a while back, the Efreti Korath seem much more friendly to you. Despite the language barrier, the Efreti Korath still tries their best to communicate to you with gestures. They are improving quick, you discover, as by now you more or less understands what they try to tell you.`
			`	For example, the slight bow the spaceport counter clerk gives you is a friendly greeting, while the Korath next to a yellow-striped blackpetrol car, waving to you and pointing to its car is offering its taxi services to you. You put your hands up, politely refusing the offer, and point to a nearby bar, inviting it to a drink instead. It nods its head, accepting the invitation.`
			`	The Korath mouth-numbing sweet drink is growing on you. It is a refreshing break from the alcoholic drinks all over human and Hai space, and the weird taste of drinks in the Coalition. The drink is slightly addicting, you admit, but as long as you consume it sparingly it should be fine.`
			`	As you and your bar-mates start engaging in increasingly wild gesturings, the bar suddenly goes still. Like all other customers, you look towards the door, only to see a Korath dressed in navy-blue uniform walking towards you.`
			`	Seeing it has caught your attention, the newcomer takes out a star map, and starts signing.`
			`	The Korath taps its cap, showing the governing emblem of the Efreti Republic, and an arm pad showing its rank in the military. Then, it moves its hand towards the map.`
			`	You look at the map. It is an old map of Korath space, showing all of the Efreti systems and some beyond. It then gestures towards a team of ten Korath trailing behind it, and your ship. Then, using its index finger the Korath makes a trail from Kashikt, through three systems you recognise as Furmeliki, Chornifath, and Hesselpost, and back to Kashikt. Through experience, you can tell that it wants you to take the ten Korath to the three systems, and back.`

Eventually, the robots tun on a green LED lamp, allowing the Korath to enter the base.`

			`	Like the rest of the spaceport, the outfitter mostly consists of a grey, featureless concrete counter where you order your parts. Seeing you, the clerk hands you the familiar card that has all the basic Korath outfits you can buy. The large Korath, seeing the short list, snatched the card from you, and start talking animatedly to the clerk, occasionally jabbing its hands towards you and the Charm-Shallop captain. The clerk turns towards you, wide-eyes shining through the gas mask, before reaching below the counter and giving you a much longer list.`
			`	You stare at the list, wide-eyed. Although you still cannot read Korath, you still understand its content thanks to the colourful diagrams printed on it. Besides the Fuel Processor and the Command Centre, the sole reasons you came to this outfitter, the card also contains far more: A new line of engines, several weapons you see equipped by the Exiles, and even the powerful Liquid Sodium Cooler.`
