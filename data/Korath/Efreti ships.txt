	description "The ancestor of the more recent civillian Charm-Shallop class miners, the Charge-Shallop was developed during the Korath Civil Wars as the Efret's most common warship. Featuring three gun-ports and two turret mounts, the Charge-Shallop is one of the more nimble and fast Korath designs, a pack of them being a serious threat to even large Model 512s."

	description `Unique to the various Korath states, the Efreti never truly dedicated its resources to war, the Guardian-Frigate being one of the only designs for this purpose. Above all, this Efreti Medium Warship prioritises survivability, boasting disproportionately high health and low mass of a ship its class.`
