	description "Developed from the ancient Deep River chasis, the Abyssal Stream-class carrier is the Wanderer's primary method of transporting and deploying drones, both in battlefield and between worlds. Consisting of a metal frame reinforcing the carrier modules in the middle, the Abyssal Stream sacrifices everything for carrying capacity and survivability. Its capacity of ten drones makes the Abyssal Stream one of the largest carriers in the galaxy."

	description "With the production of Flycatcher drones, the question of moving them between worlds have become a focus of Wanderer research efforts. The Squall is the result of their efforts, a new design capable of carrying four of the drones and two Hailstone fighters in a single fight. Because of the Unfettered Hai's aggressive tactics, this carrier is heavily armoured and shielded, providing a reliable firing platform in fights."

#Hailstones and Graupels are the fighters and drones carried on Squalls. Some of the strongest currently in service, rivalling even the Remnant.

	description "The existence of the Solifuge showed the Wanderers the effectiveness of carried fighter combat, and the Hailstone is developed as an answer to the Violin Spider. While heavier ships such as the Hurricane and the Heavy Gust distracts enemy firepower, these fighters will sneak in and quickly disable enemy ships using two Moonbeam lasers."

	description `The Graupel is a combat-oriented modification of the Flycatcher. Replacing the single turret mount with a gun port, the Graupel is able to field comparatively more powerful armaments compared to the Flycatcher, allowing it to carry out certain combat operations not worth risking pilots for.`

Expanded engine space also allows it to carry out interception roles, quickly disabling enemy ships with its six gun ports."
