			`It has been a while since you have set foot on the Wanderer capital. The stress of stopping the Alphas' attack and the negotiations with the Korath exiles have stressed you out, and you decide to take a stroll in this beautiful planet.`
			`	When you are about to leave the spaceport, you catch sight of a gigantic Riptide-class transport landing. To your surprise, the Wanderer passengers within do not leave the spaceport, quickly boarding another Riptide a short distance away. Several Wanderers from Vara K'chrai itself also join this group, and before long the Riptide takes off.`
			`	Interplanetary passenger transportation jobs are commonplace throughout the Milky Way. Usually, passengers commissions a starship captain for the whole journey in one go. Seldom does anybody change ships in the middle, and certainly not groups this big. Weirded out, you decide to ask a security officer in the spaceport.`
			`	"These Wanderers are [moving, migrating] to the worlds beyond the Eye," replies the security officer, "To organise transports [effectively, efficiently] our government decides to transport everyone here, before moving them to Spera Anatrusk on the other side."`
			`	It appears that the Wanderers have standardised the evacuation efforts. You silently wish the evacuating Wanderers the best of luck.`

			`	At first, Ikgalef gets even angrier as you seemingly side with the Wanderers over his "true Korath", but then his demeanor changes when you start mentioning the Wanderers' conflict with the Unfettered Hai in the North, and how the Eye brought the Wanderers here.`
			`	"Hai? The be'oof in the North?"`
			`	"Yes, Ikgalef," you say, "A group of millitant Hai attacked the Wanderers, and they are now going through a wormhole that leads them here."`

			`One thing that starts bugging you, is how firm the highly principled and pacifistic Wanderers are treating the issue of Spera Anatrusk. After all, if the Wanderers are acquiescing to the Unfettered Hai's dubious claims to their northern worlds, the Wanderers should naturally recognise the Sestor's claims to the Korath worlds as well. After all, Wanderer psychology is different from human.`
			`	"It is undeniable that these worlds were once occupied by the Korath," you say, "Just like how the Hai once occupied the lands in the North."`
			`	"This is indeed true. Hence, when the Unfettered Hai came to reclaim their planets, we allow them in. The Keepers led us here, and this is where our new job is."`

			`	"These Wanderer birds, leave through a wormhole because Hai chase them out?"`
			`	"No, no," you reply, "The Wanderers are leaving anyway, but the Hai were impatient."`
			`	Ikgalef lets out a bark, as he starts snickering. Rek and Tele'ek looks on, unamused.`
			`	"Leave? They flee, Rafeki Captain <last>! They cannot defeat Hai, yet they are prideful. They must feel ashamed. They do not want you to know that, and make the story up."`
			`	"Do not [insult, make fun of] our soldiers," a cold voice slices through the Sestor president's speech, "We do not [fight, struggle] for territories we do not own" You turn, and see Sobari Tele'ek clenching his claws, eyes focussed on the Korath.`
			`	"Who fight and lose on purpose?" Ikgalef seems to disagree, "Nobody lose planets on purpose. You are just too embarrassed to admit defeat!"`
			`	"Those planets are not ours to claim! We merely terraform them then leave! The Keepers guide us, and the Eye lead us, to new planets! The ones we are standing on!" Rek, normally eternally cheerful, is also starting to become frustrated.`
			`	"Your ancestors work night and day, fight scale-and-claw for each planet they get, and now you flee on the first chance of escape. Have you no shame?"`
			`	"We do not fight for planets that is not ours," interrupts Rek, "You have not been listening to us."`
			`	"Do you not arrive to the planets abandoned and empty? Do you not build them up yourselves? Have you never called the planets home?" Ikgalef presses on.`
			`	Rek starts to reply, "Yes, we did. But now the Hai are claiming them back, and-"`
			`	"Then those planets are yours!" Ikgalef ejaculates angrily, "Your kind lives on the planets, not the Hai. Your kind build it up, not the Hai. Those planets are your territory, not the Hai's!"`
			`	As Rek starts opening her mouth to argue back, you realise that, once again, the conversation has turned hostile and unproductive...`

				`(Ikgalef thinks that, if Wanderers settled on empty planets and built it up themselves, then the planets are the Wanderers'. By the same logic, the Wanderers also settled on the Anatruskor planets in an empty state, and built them up. By this logic, those planets are also the Wanderers'.)`

			`	"This is totally different!" Ikgalef counters, "The Anatruskor still exist! The last planet-dwellers perished less than a century ago! They have been in Hai space for millennia!"`
			`	"Time is irrelevant here, Ikgalef," you counter, "There is no difference between the Wanderers' colonisation of Vara K'chrai and Spera Anatrusk."`
			`	"The Hai abandoned their planets like the cowards they are! We Korath never abandoned them!"`

			`	"I don't care about your keeper ralukut," Ikgalef interjects, "Instead of fighting the thieving Hai, you want to fight Korath to steal planets to retreat to."`

				goto telespeech

			`Silence is golden, and it is best to keep your head cool and your mouth shut.`
			`	Unimpeded, Rek retorts, "Planets are ours only when we claim it so, and we do not. They were once Hai planets, and we give the planets back to the Hai when they ask it back."`
			`	"Then why are you fighting and losing?"`
			`	"We did not lose!" exclaims Rek, producing a map out of the suitcase Tele'ek was bringing,"We give our planets to the Hai, as long as we can evacuate our brethren. We are holding our capital, because we need it to evacuate the rest of us!"`

			`This argument, you realise, increasingly resembles children fighting over toys both want. The only way forward here, is an alternative proposal. As Ikgalef is constantly berating the Wanderers' plans, it would be a good idea to hear whether he has an alternative proposal instead.`

			`	"Ah, eh, n-" Rek sputters, but is quickly cut off by Tele'ek.`
			`	"We shall [discuss, debate] this proposal amongst ourselves."`
			`	"You should," Ikgalef replies, "The Sestor look forward to a fruitful cooperation."`
			`	Rek turns towards Tele'ek, a look of disbelief and disapproval, but Tele'ek maintains his steeled face, and looks back. Rek decides to switch topics instead.`
			`	"The argument before had derailed the conversation a lot," the young Wanderer diplomat states, "We were here about the Mereti drones."`
			`	Ikgalef raises an eyebrow, but says nothing.`
			`	"Through past efforts, we have successfully pacified them," says Rek, "They are no longer hostile to any factions by default. Please stop attacking them."`
			`	Ikgalef seems to want to discuss more, but he stops. "Sure," he mutters.`
			`	With that, the meeting comes to an anticlimatic end. Ikgalef waves the three of you goodbye, as a Korath assistant hands the three of you confectionary. They are mildly sweet, reminding you of a certain type of candy you had on New Sahara.`

It is not him being fat, you note, having seen obese Wanderers struggling to fly in cities before. As it is rather rude to point out health problems to someone you are not too acquainted with, you decide to not say anything.`

			`	"Interesting," you say. Compared to the first time Tele'ek showed you warships, he seems much less disgusted at these weapons. Maybe Tele'ek's bloating illness is slowly affecting him.`
			`	"After the Sestor drones bombed our planet, demand for such a weapon [skyrocketed, soared]. We are [afraid, anxious, scared] another automaton invasion might happen."`
			`	"The two Korath factions are pacified," you say.`
			`	"True, but they serve well to [placate, pacify] the public in fear," Tele'ek replies, a slight hint of sadness tinting his voice. With that, Tele'ek becomes silent, and beckons you towards the exit.`
			`	"Wait, Tele'ek, what is the other ship here?" you ask.`
			`	"The hull is slated for [dismantlement, disassembly]," replies Tele'ek, "This model is originally made to counter the [aggressive, belligerent] robots. The robots are no longer [antagonistic, hostile], and this design becomes unnecessary."`
			`	"You spent months building this ship, and now you are giving up?"`
			`	"This model is never finished. It is not needed, and there is no [reason, point] to continue development."`
			`	You remember Tele'ek being disgusted by the development of the Tempest, and expect him to feel nothing but joy. Tele'ek, instead, quietly guides you through the door, head lowered, refusing to look at the hull. There is no shred of happiness in his actions. Rather, Tele'ek seems strangely depressed.`
			`	Tele'ek's mood improves as the tour continues. You see several Wanderer scientists experimenting on different metal plates and certain organic tissues, noting their properties and reaction to the environment. Giant reactors are configured to try mass-producing newly developed mixtures, while large machines you have no idea what it does churn out metal plates for testing.`
			`	You stop in front of a familiar sight: A textile machine making a new military uniform every two seconds. Part of you are in awe of its efficiency, and part of you feel relieved you quit your job as a textile worker to become a starship captain. You are getting replaced as soon as this Wanderer technology enters human space.`
			`	This entire complex is a giant military lab, something you expect to be present in the most secure Republic worlds. Somehow you never expected a pacifistic race like the Wanderers having such a dedicated facility for military research. To develop the Derecho and the Hurricane so quickly, however, they must have an exquisite research and development division. Before you know it, your tour around the Wanderer complex comes to an end.`
			`	As the Wanderer scientists continue their work in grim determination, Tele'ek bids you farewell. His attitude throughout the tour is rather surprising, going completely unexpected. Again, probably because he is molting. You decide to go to a bar, have a drink, and forget your worries.`

			`Skilfully manoeuvring between Unfettered Hai radars, you manage to land on Varu Mer'ek's old spaceport without being noticed. Native plants grow quick, and the old spaceport is already covered by trees.`
			`	Tele'ek disembarks from your ship along with you, and begins hiking to the nearest mountain. It takes a long time, however, as Tele'ek's bloated body impedes his movements somewhat, and you find yourself frequently helping Tele'ek through the hardest parts of the course. On the peak, Tele'ek releases a small drone, which quickly flies off to the distance.`
			`	"The drone is fitted with cameras and a small cloak," Tele'ek explains, chest slightly puffed, "It can fly through crowds without being noticed."`
			`	You and Tele'ek sits on the mountain, watching the drone's feedback on Tele'ek's computer terminal. For a few minutes, the footage shows nothing but rolling hills and plains, until a city slowly grows larger.`
			`	"This is the former planet capital," Tele'ek explains in a neutral tone, "This was once the library - it seems the Hai [made, transformed] it into a barrack. This open area, Captain, was once a garden. It's now a shooting range. The former research centre..."`
			`	Tele'ek's voice slowly becomes more and more gravelly, as he talks at an increasingly fast pace.`
			`	"The zoo is now a wrestling ring. The spaceport cafeteria is another wrestling ring. The community centre is now a [betting shop, casino]. The greenhouses are looted and empty."`
			`	Suddenly, Tele'ek begins to hyperventilate. A sudden jerk to the joystick sends the drone directly into a collision course with a nearby Hai's head. You quickly pitch the drone up, so it merely ruffles the Hai's fur instead. This is enough to trigger the Hai, however, as it begins to dance wildly to swat what it assumes to be a fly. Tele'ek, regaining his senses, quickly flies the drone away from the Hai and into the sky.`
			`	"Sorry, Captain, I lost my [temper, composure]. I must focus on the target, the factories."`
			`	Eventually, Tele'ek manages to sneak the drone into the heavily guarded main factory. Inside, you find assembly lines constantly churning out Shield Beetles, Solifuges, and the new "Phrynus" ship you encountered yesterday.`
			`	"So this is where they make all their new ships without needing Jump Drives," you say, "Do you have any explosives with you? We can bomb this factory now, and delay their production."`
			`	Tele'ek's eyebrows perk up, but he quickly regains a neutral expression.`
			`	"Our job here is to [scout, infiltrate] the Unfettered Hai, and devise new strategies to defend our planets while civilians evacuate. We are not here to [destroy, harm] the Hai. After all, we are but [visitors, tourists], not inhabitants. If the Hai are their destined owners, so be it."`
			`	Tele'ek sounds somewhat downcast by the end of it, but you decide not to inquire further. Molting is an enigmatic process, after all.`
			`	The drone flies to the factory's other rooms. Assembly lines for Violin Spider-class fighters are prominent, but you also see the Hai welding crates marked with the Explosive warning to some of the fighters, while replacing their cockpits with some sort of machine. Suicide bombers, you quickly realise. By the severe look Tele'ek sports, he is aware of it too.`
			`	Most other rooms are of lesser productions. Pulse Cannons, turret mounts, and armour platings are being wrought here using high-precision machinery. A few rooms are dedicated to painting the ships with the Unfettered's purple colour scheme, but other than that, there are no remarkable discoveries.`
			`	As the Sun slowly sets, Tele'ek recalls the drone, and you hike back to the ship, once again supporting Tele'ek's bulbous, unwieldy body. By the time you return to your ship, it is night time. Carefully, you lift off, and prepare for the return journey back to Vara K'chrai.`

			`As you land at Vara K'chrai's spaceport, you notice a new ship parking on the apron next to you.`
			`	The ship looks like a shorter Deep River, but with its cargo holds reinforced with metal bars. You watch as spaceport workers tug a pair of Flycatcher drones underneath the cargo holds. Suddenly, large clamps appear below the cargo holds, grab onto the drones, and lift them inside the ship. You realise that this ship is in fact a carrier, created to transport the Wanderers' previously planetbound drones.`
			`	"This ship will provide our fleet with ample anti-missile protection," a voice rings behind you. You swivel around, and see the bulgy body of Sobari Tele'ek wadding over to you.`
			`	"It is nice to see that a carrier is developed," you say, "But without attack drones, its utility is limited."`
			`	"We are [defenders, protectors], not attackers," replies Tele'ek, "There is no need for offensive drones to be made."`
			`	"Combat drones lower casualty rate, meaning you do not have to fight at all," you counter, unconvinced.`
			`	"Maybe, but our [aim, goal] against the Hai is to defend. Combat drones and fighters are good for offensive purposes, but merely [waste, take up] resources on defensive battles."`
