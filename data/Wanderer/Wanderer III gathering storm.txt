			`It has been a while since you have set foot on the Wanderer capital. The stress of stopping the Alphas' attack and the negotiations with the Korath exiles have stressed you out, and you decide to take a stroll in this beautiful planet.`
			`	When you are about to leave the spaceport, you catch sight of a gigantic Riptide-class transport landing. To your surprise, the Wanderer passengers within do not leave the spaceport, quickly boarding another Riptide a short distance away. Several Wanderers from Vara K'chrai itself also join this group, and before long the Riptide takes off.`
			`	Interplanetary passenger transportation jobs are commonplace throughout the Milky Way. Usually, passengers commissions a starship captain for the whole journey in one go. Seldom does anybody change ships in the middle, and certainly not groups this big. Weirded out, you decide to ask a security officer in the spaceport.`
			`	"These Wanderers are [moving, migrating] to the worlds beyond the Eye," replies the security officer, "To organise transports [effectively, efficiently] our government decides to transport everyone here, before moving them to Spera Anatrusk on the other side."`
			`	It appears that the Wanderers have standardised the evacuation efforts. You silently wish the evacuating Wanderers the best of luck.`

			`	At first, Ikgalef gets even angrier as you seemingly side with the Wanderers over his "true Korath", but then his demeanor changes when you start mentioning the Wanderers' conflict with the Unfettered Hai in the North, and how the Eye brought the Wanderers here.`
			`	"Hai? The be'oof in the North?"`
			`	"Yes, Ikgalef," you say, "A group of millitant Hai attacked the Wanderers, and they are now going through a wormhole that leads them here."`

			`One thing that starts bugging you, is how firm the highly principled and pacifistic Wanderers are treating the issue of Spera Anatrusk. After all, if the Wanderers are acquiescing to the Unfettered Hai's dubious claims to their northern worlds, the Wanderers should naturally recognise the Sestor's claims to the Korath worlds as well. After all, Wanderer psychology is different from human.`
			`	"It is undeniable that these worlds were once occupied by the Korath," you say, "Just like how the Hai once occupied the lands in the North."`
			`	"This is indeed true. Hence, when the Unfettered Hai came to reclaim their planets, we allow them in. The Keepers led us here, and this is where our new job is."`

			`	"These Wanderer birds, leave through a wormhole because Hai chase them out?"`
			`	"No, no," you reply, "The Wanderers are leaving anyway, but the Hai were impatient."`
			`	Ikgalef lets out a bark, as he starts snickering. Rek and Tele'ek looks on, unamused.`
			`	"Leave? They flee, Rafeki Captain <last>! They cannot defeat Hai, yet they are prideful. They must feel ashamed. They do not want you to know that, and make the story up."`
			`	"Do not [insult, make fun of] our soldiers," a cold voice slices through the Sestor president's speech, "We do not [fight, struggle] for territories we do not own" You turn, and see Sobari Tele'ek clenching his claws, eyes focussed on the Korath.`
			`	"Who fight and lose on purpose?" Ikgalef seems to disagree, "Nobody lose planets on purpose. You are just too embarrassed to admit defeat!"`
			`	"Those planets are not ours to claim! We merely terraform them then leave! The Keepers guide us, and the Eye lead us, to new planets! The ones we are standing on!" Rek, normally eternally cheerful, is also starting to become frustrated.`
			`	"Your ancestors work night and day, fight scale-and-claw for each planet they get, and now you flee on the first chance of escape. Have you no shame?"`
			`	"We do not fight for planets that is not ours," interrupts Rek, "You have not been listening to us."`
			`	"Do you not arrive to the planets abandoned and empty? Do you not build them up yourselves? Have you never called the planets home?" Ikgalef presses on.`
			`	Rek starts to reply, "Yes, we did. But now the Hai are claiming them back, and-"`
			`	"Then those planets are yours!" Ikgalef ejaculates angrily, "Your kind lives on the planets, not the Hai. Your kind build it up, not the Hai. Those planets are your territory, not the Hai's!"`
			`	As Rek starts opening her mouth to argue back, you realise that, once again, the conversation has turned hostile and unproductive...`

				`(Ikgalef thinks that, if Wanderers settled on empty planets and built it up themselves, then the planets are the Wanderers'. By the same logic, the Wanderers also settled on the Anatruskor planets in an empty state, and built them up. By this logic, those planets are also the Wanderers'.)`

			`	"This is totally different!" Ikgalef counters, "The Anatruskor still exist! The last planet-dwellers perished less than a century ago! They have been in Hai space for millennia!"`
			`	"Time is irrelevant here, Ikgalef," you counter, "There is no difference between the Wanderers' colonisation of Vara K'chrai and Spera Anatrusk."`
			`	"The Hai abandoned their planets like the cowards they are! We Korath never abandoned them!"`

			`	"I don't care about your keeper ralukut," Ikgalef interjects, "Instead of fighting the thieving Hai, you want to fight Korath to steal planets to retreat to."`

				goto telespeech

			`Silence is golden, and it is best to keep your head cool and your mouth shut.`
			`	Unimpeded, Rek retorts, "Planets are ours only when we claim it so, and we do not. They were once Hai planets, and we give the planets back to the Hai when they ask it back."`
			`	"Then why are you fighting and losing?"`
			`	"We did not lose!" exclaims Rek, producing a map out of the suitcase Tele'ek was bringing,"We give our planets to the Hai, as long as we can evacuate our brethren. We are holding our capital, because we need it to evacuate the rest of us!"`

			`This argument, you realise, increasingly resembles children fighting over toys both want. The only way forward here, is an alternative proposal. As Ikgalef is constantly berating the Wanderers' plans, it would be a good idea to hear whether he has an alternative proposal instead.`

			`	"Ah, eh, n-" Rek sputters, but is quickly cut off by Tele'ek.`
			`	"We shall [discuss, debate] this proposal amongst ourselves."`
			`	"You should," Ikgalef replies, "The Sestor look forward to a fruitful cooperation."`
			`	Rek turns towards Tele'ek, a look of disbelief and disapproval, but Tele'ek maintains his steeled face, and looks back. Rek decides to switch topics instead.`
			`	"The argument before had derailed the conversation a lot," the young Wanderer diplomat states, "We were here about the Mereti drones."`
			`	Ikgalef raises an eyebrow, but says nothing.`
			`	"Through past efforts, we have successfully pacified them," says Rek, "They are no longer hostile to any factions by default. Please stop attacking them."`
			`	Ikgalef seems to want to discuss more, but he stops. "Sure," he mutters.`
			`	With that, the meeting comes to an anticlimatic end. Ikgalef waves the three of you goodbye, as a Korath assistant hands the three of you confectionary. They are mildly sweet, reminding you of a certain type of candy you had on New Sahara.`

It is not him being fat, you note, having seen obese Wanderers struggling to fly in cities before. As it is rather rude to point out health problems to someone you are not too acquainted with, you decide to not say anything.`

			`	"Interesting," you say. Compared to the first time Tele'ek showed you warships, he seems much less disgusted at these weapons. Maybe Tele'ek's bloating illness is slowly affecting him.`
			`	"After the Sestor drones bombed our planet, demand for such a weapon [skyrocketed, soared]. We are [afraid, anxious, scared] another automaton invasion might happen."`
			`	"The two Korath factions are pacified," you say.`
			`	"True, but they serve well to [placate, pacify] the public in fear," Tele'ek replies, a slight hint of sadness tinting his voice. With that, Tele'ek becomes silent, and beckons you towards the exit.`
			`	"Wait, Tele'ek, what is the other ship here?" you ask.`
			`	"The hull is slated for [dismantlement, disassembly]," replies Tele'ek, "This model is originally made to counter the [aggressive, belligerent] robots. The robots are no longer [antagonistic, hostile], and this design becomes unnecessary."`
			`	"You spent months building this ship, and now you are giving up?"`
			`	"This model is never finished. It is not needed, and there is no [reason, point] to continue development."`
			`	You remember Tele'ek being disgusted by the development of the Tempest, and expect him to feel nothing but joy. Tele'ek, instead, quietly guides you through the door, head lowered, refusing to look at the hull. There is no shred of happiness in his actions. Rather, Tele'ek seems strangely depressed.`
			`	Tele'ek's mood improves as the tour continues. You see several Wanderer scientists experimenting on different metal plates and certain organic tissues, noting their properties and reaction to the environment. Giant reactors are configured to try mass-producing newly developed mixtures, while large machines you have no idea what it does churn out metal plates for testing.`
			`	You stop in front of a familiar sight: A textile machine making a new military uniform every two seconds. Part of you are in awe of its efficiency, and part of you feel relieved you quit your job as a textile worker to become a starship captain. You are getting replaced as soon as this Wanderer technology enters human space.`
			`	This entire complex is a giant military lab, something you expect to be present in the most secure Republic worlds. Somehow you never expected a pacifistic race like the Wanderers having such a dedicated facility for military research. To develop the Derecho and the Hurricane so quickly, however, they must have an exquisite research and development division. Before you know it, your tour around the Wanderer complex comes to an end.`
			`	As the Wanderer scientists continue their work in grim determination, Tele'ek bids you farewell. His attitude throughout the tour is rather surprising, going completely unexpected. Again, probably because he is molting. You decide to go to a bar, have a drink, and forget your worries.`

			`Skilfully manoeuvring between Unfettered Hai radars, you manage to land on Varu Mer'ek's old spaceport without being noticed. Native plants grow quick, and the old spaceport is already covered by trees.`
			`	Tele'ek disembarks from your ship along with you, and begins hiking to the nearest mountain. It takes a long time, however, as Tele'ek's bloated body impedes his movements somewhat, and you find yourself frequently helping Tele'ek through the hardest parts of the course. On the peak, Tele'ek releases a small drone, which quickly flies off to the distance.`
			`	"The drone is fitted with cameras and a small cloak," Tele'ek explains, chest slightly puffed, "It can fly through crowds without being noticed."`
			`	You and Tele'ek sits on the mountain, watching the drone's feedback on Tele'ek's computer terminal. For a few minutes, the footage shows nothing but rolling hills and plains, until a city slowly grows larger.`
			`	"This is the former planet capital," Tele'ek explains in a neutral tone, "This was once the library - it seems the Hai [made, transformed] it into a barrack. This open area, Captain, was once a garden. It's now a shooting range. The former research centre..."`
			`	Tele'ek's voice slowly becomes more and more gravelly, as he talks at an increasingly fast pace.`
			`	"The zoo is now a wrestling ring. The spaceport cafeteria is another wrestling ring. The community centre is now a [betting shop, casino]. The greenhouses are looted and empty."`
			`	Suddenly, Tele'ek begins to hyperventilate. A sudden jerk to the joystick sends the drone directly into a collision course with a nearby Hai's head. You quickly pitch the drone up, so it merely ruffles the Hai's fur instead. This is enough to trigger the Hai, however, as it begins to dance wildly to swat what it assumes to be a fly. Tele'ek, regaining his senses, quickly flies the drone away from the Hai and into the sky.`
			`	"Sorry, Captain, I lost my [temper, composure]. I must focus on the target, the factories."`
			`	Eventually, Tele'ek manages to sneak the drone into the heavily guarded main factory. Inside, you find assembly lines constantly churning out Shield Beetles, Solifuges, and the new "Phrynus" ship you encountered yesterday.`
			`	"So this is where they make all their new ships without needing Jump Drives," you say, "Do you have any explosives with you? We can bomb this factory now, and delay their production."`
			`	Tele'ek's eyebrows perk up, but he quickly regains a neutral expression.`
			`	"Our job here is to [scout, infiltrate] the Unfettered Hai, and devise new strategies to defend our planets while civilians evacuate. We are not here to [destroy, harm] the Hai. After all, we are but [visitors, tourists], not inhabitants. If the Hai are their destined owners, so be it."`
			`	Tele'ek sounds somewhat downcast by the end of it, but you decide not to inquire further. Molting is an enigmatic process, after all.`
			`	The drone flies to the factory's other rooms. Assembly lines for Violin Spider-class fighters are prominent, but you also see the Hai welding crates marked with the Explosive warning to some of the fighters, while replacing their cockpits with some sort of machine. Suicide bombers, you quickly realise. By the severe look Tele'ek sports, he is aware of it too.`
			`	Most other rooms are of lesser productions. Pulse Cannons, turret mounts, and armour platings are being wrought here using high-precision machinery. A few rooms are dedicated to painting the ships with the Unfettered's purple colour scheme, but other than that, there are no remarkable discoveries.`
			`	As the Sun slowly sets, Tele'ek recalls the drone, and you hike back to the ship, once again supporting Tele'ek's bulbous, unwieldy body. By the time you return to your ship, it is night time. Carefully, you lift off, and prepare for the return journey back to Vara K'chrai.`

			`Upon landing, Ektasi Rek and you boards a bus, which to your surprise runs on old-fashioned internal combustion engines. The low humming of the engines are mesmerising, but Rek only shows distaste at this primitive transportation method.`
			`	The bus takes the two of you outside the spaceport and the industrial zone, and the air slowly gets less acidic and more breathable. Eventually, it stops outside of a pearly white building on the outskirts of the city, where plants are prominently seen and the air is completely breathable.`
			`	The Efreti governmental building is completely sealed. Air showers blow off all dust from your clothes before you enter, and large metal detectors are present to confirm that you and Rek are indeed unarmed. With all checks complete, you are allowed into the meeting room.`
			`	The meeting room is massive. A long, oak table is situated in the middle, with matching chairs. On the one of the walls near the table's end hangs a large, purple Efreti emblem and a portrait of a Korath. As you sit, a Korath aide skilfully pours you a cup of tea.`

			`	"Hello, Ms. Urpasom," Rek begins, "Thank you for arranging this meeting in short notice."`
			`	The meeting goes on for a while. Between Rek's slow, deliberate movements and Urpasom's more fluid movements, you are surprised but proud that you are able to follow the flow of the conversation. Apparently, the Wanderers wish to start a new colony down in Solima Skarati, which is a former Korsmanath territory. Unfortunately, the Korsmanath are staunch Efreti allies.`
			`	"Please understand, Ms. Rek, that we consider Solima Skarati our own, and we wish to settle it ourselves. Your help is appreciated, but we do not need it."`
			`	"Again, we are here to fix worlds. That world has a toxic ocean biome, which means it cannot be settled without any precautions. We can reverse it."`
			`	"Thank you for your help so far," Urpasom says, "Precisely due to the lessons we have learnt, we are hoping to settle a planet ourselves as a practise ground, without your assistance. Solima Skarati, with its relatively simple toxins, seem to be a perfect start."`
			`	"My reports indicate that the techological exchange we are having is insufficient to facilitate a successful terraformation and settlement. Many Korath will die if rash action is taken."`
			`	"Thank you for your concern, but we believe we can handle this planet. After all, we do not rely on biology alone to survive on ravaged worlds," Urpasom replies, a hint of smugness as you identify.`
			`	It appears that neither side is backing down soon. Rek still wants Wanderers to fix the planet, but Urpasom is adamant that the Efreti be the sole occupiers. You also realise you are in the perfect position to resolve this crisis.`
			`	And so you begin gesturing, the first time you actively engage in a conversation in Korath, to Korath. Urpasom emits a surprised yelp as you begin.`

			`	You see both Rek and Urpasom calming down slightly, motioning you to continue.`
			`	"We turn Solima Skarati into a condominium of sorts," you elaborate, "The Korath will be the ones settling on this planet, but the Wanderers will have a settlement as well, overseeing the terraformation."`
			`	Both Rek and Urpasom consider this proposal for a while, before ultimately accepting. You congratulate yourself internally, for solving a diplomatic incident the first time you speak Korath.`
			label end
			`	It appears that the meeting is all about settlement plans. With the Anatruskor settling their worlds quickly, only Korsmanath and Efreti planets are open for Wanderer settlement. Without further agreements, the meeting ends.`
			`	Rek says that she will remain on Laki Nemparu for a while, and thanks you for the transportation. As you part, you suddenly realise the entire time you had been speaking in Korath. Today marks your mastery of the Korath language, being able to communicate with the reptilian aliens with ease.`

			`As you wander around the spaceport, looking for more jobs for you from the Sestor, you cannot help but feel a little bit frustrated. Unlike with many other species' spaces, where you can directly ask the client if they have any special needs, food allergies, or other things to note, here in Sestor space you can only communicate via drawings and rudimentary gestures. It is not hard to see why; the language barrier is a limitation very hard to overcome.`
			`	This was not a big problem at first when you have Ikgalef, who can talk in the common Human tongue thanks to a large translator. As time goes on, however, the impacts of the language barrier is becoming clearer and clearer. If you can learn the Korath language the Sestor uses, you would have a much better time in Sestor space.`
			`	Do you contact Ikgalef to learn Sestor?`

				`Yes!`

			`	The train ride to Ikgalef's office once again shows you how the Sestor communicate. The words here are of a harsh tone, and the dance moves are fluid and dramatic. While there are similarities between these movements and those you saw in Efreti space, it is rather obvious that the pronunciations and the gestures are different.`
			`	As you walk into the Sestor governmental offices, Ikgalef has just finished being questioned by various Sestor parliament members for various points of its policy in the past. A rather tired Ikgalef greets you.`
			`	"Elections are coming up, <first>, and the opposition is ramping up their campaign, as our lands grow more secure," grumbles the Sestor President, "They won't win, however. I brought us back to glory, not them."`
			`	Being an outsider, you are considerably less interested in Sestor politics than anyone else on this planet, and the topic soon shifts to the language issue.`

			`	Ikgalef's mood visibly improves as he rants on about the Korath language. It seems that the Korath language, as he stated, relies on gestures as much as speech, as some sort of hybrid language.`

			`	"I have been learning Korath from the Wanderers," you begin, "But it seems that the Efreti speaks differently compared to you."`

			`	"Stop, stop, Rafeki captain, the Efreti are naught but a band of perversion that poisons our sacred culture! You must not pay them any more attention than you need to strictly!"`
			`	Seeing Ikgalef going into another anti-Efreti rant, you slowly tune out the incoming noises. It is only fair for Ikgalef to let off some steam, after the presumably stressful interrogation in the Sestor Parliament. As it finishes, however, Ikgalef leads you out of the room.`
			`	"Hmph, at least you are not contaminated with Efreti views yet, which is a great relief. Come with me!"`
			label languagestart
			`	You follow Ikgalef as you make your way into the city. A brief tram ride later, you emerge into what looks like an elementary school. You see schoolchildren leaving the building, gawking at the President and you. They cannot be older than five to six, you think. Smiling, Ikgalef does a waving gesture you assume to be similar to a human wave, and you follow suit. The children visibly brightens at it, and begins to chatter amongst themselves. Ikgalef smiles and leads you into the school building.`
			`	The school building reminds you strongly of the classes in New Boston. Plushes, spaceship models, puzzles, and other kinds of games and toys are all around, as a form of chalk-less blackboard is filled with various diagrams and symbols.`
			`	"This is Sopi Lefarkata's central school," Ikgalef says, "All our hatchlings study here for twelve years until they graduate."`
			`	In the middle of a classroom with many pictures, symbols, and Korath stick figures around, lies a pile of small, black holograph projectors. Compared to the ones you see in Ikgalef's office or in the various Sestor meeting rooms, this seems simpler and somewhat bulkier.`
			`	Ikgalef picks up one of the projectors, and presses a small button. A holographic image of a Korath appears, and it quickly begins to speak in Sestor. Naturally, you do not understand a single word.`
			`	"Take it," says Ikgalef, "This is a standard language learner given to every single hatchling. It should help you too."`
			`	"Ikgalef, I don't understand a single word it's saying," you reply, "It won't help with grammar."`
			`	"Everyone will have to start somewhere," Ikgalef replies, "Try to notice and emulate my movements."`
			`	With that, Ikgalef waves at a sensor, and the room shines a beacon of light on it.`
			`	"Observe, <first>!" Ikgalef says, "Hello! Nice to meet you..."`
			`	For the next two hours, Ikgalef slowly goes through the most basic of Sestor vocabularies with you, donning and taking off the translation device to let you know how the words actually sound. You record the whole session your personal digital assistant with the President's permission, for your future reference.`
			`	As the day winds down, Ikgalef hands you a stack of books. Apparently, living in bunkers in a constant warzone makes physical copies of texts much more valuable in Sestor space than elsewhere. You feel a strange wave of nostalgia; physical books are rare outside of New Boston.`
			`	You thank Ikgalef, promising to study the Sestor language in earnest. On your train ride to the hostel and back to the spaceport the next day, you find yourself starting to understand small parts of the broadcasts.`

			`While the various markings on the Sestor bunker entrance still cannot be read, you can somewhat understand the spaceport clerks' greetings. Perhaps the greatest cultural shock is the lack of "Good morning" or "good afternoon", replacing it with a universal "Hello" instead. Moreover, the spaceport broadcasts seem much more intelligible to you. Although most words are still unrecognisable, you start to recognise the grammar structure.

A large boxing ring is present in the school's gymnasium, where young Korath hatchlings in full protective gear fight against each other, as spectators cheer and jive. A comprehensive medical team is visible on full alert near the rings.`
			`	You start talking to Ikgalef in Sestor without it using the translation device. Simple greeting, asking for directions, inviting for a drink, the usual stuff. Satisfied, the lesson carries on.`
			`	The Kor Efret style themselves as the "Korath Friends" or "Friendly Korath". Somehow you expect, despite all the differences, "Friend" in Korath will still be "Efret". Ikgalef is quick to correct you that, in Sestor, "friend" is "rafeki" instead. You wonder whether the Sestor-Efreti animosity contribute to this change.`
			`	Today, Ikgalef focusses its efforts in the less common everyday words. From the underground trains that travel everywhere in the cities, to the various algae and fish that made up the delicious soup the first time you were here, to the various services and stations that may provide emergency help, these words would be sufficient for you to communicate in most situations.`

#Sestor language mission 3. More excuse to show Sestor culture (as opposed to Efreti and Exile). Unlike the Efreti, the Sestor is a free democratic society, and the Korath are much more expressive and liberal. Unlike the Exiles, the Efreti do not have the deep insecurity and scarring the Drak ingrained into them. Of all, the Sestor resembles the old Korath culture the most, where the deity Isi'i is revered the most.
#Beginning here, most conversation between FL and Korath will be in Korath language. (After Exile language, as well). Korath language rules apply:
#No past/future tense. Broad generalisations. Dances frequently, sometimes only dance. Occasional untranslated words. Frequent swears.

			`	Ikgalef is beaming when he sees you enter. "As expected, it is our victory! The opposition had no chance," Ikgalef dances wildly.`
			`	Elections seems to be a huge part in Sestor society. Perhaps because of this, Ikgalef focusses the lesson on Sestor culture and identity. "We are the true Korath," emphasizes Ikgalef, "We are the scions of Isi'i."`
			`	Ikgalef's words and gestures become considerably stiffer and serious, as it talks about Isi'i, the three-eyed god of Creation and Destruction. In a reverent voice, Ikgalef begins recounting Isi'i's presence.`

Isi'i governs change, for without destruction there can be no creation. Through light and the dark, through the peace and the war, Isi'i watches over all Korath."`

Slowly, Ikgalef begins to chant and dance at the same time. A graceful dance and a short chant later, Ikgalef thanks you, as it hands you a small, red feather on its back.`

			`	"I don't have a pouch like you yet, but I will treasure it," you say.`
			`	Ikgalef seems pleased by your reverence.`
			`	As you both walk towards the nearby restaurant you both frequent after the meetings, Ikgalef looks at you, and starts speaking.`

#Final lesson. Rek sends FL for a mission in Sestor space. FL, if successful, becomes fluent in Korath language.
#Efreti room is modelled after the Kremlin meeting room. Sestor is modelled after the one in the White House.
#The way I portray the difference between "syncreistic" and "original" Korath gestalts, is that the Efreti are outwardly more reserved and controlled, while the Sestor readily expresses their emotions. Ultimately, however, the Efreti are as emotional as the Sestor, as seen by Urpasom's outburst. 
#Both Efreti and Sestor have very strong "with-us-or-against-us" mentality. Ditto for the exiles, but they are too busy to care.

			`The spaceport on Sopi Lefarkata is like last time, tucked away behind a disguised mountain side. As you come in for the landing, you see a few Sestor drones preparing for takeoff. After all these years, you still cannot help but feel their imposing, powerful aura.`
			`	Ikgalef is already waiting for you, like how it always did. Quickly, the three of you enter into a pod, speeding through the Sestor city into the governmental building.`
			`	As you walk through Sopi Lefarkata's government hall, you see a giant indoor flagpole flying the Sestor Federation's crimson flag, its bold, agressive printing contrasting well against the milder Efreti emblem. The Sestor's meeting room, however, is much more modest than the Efreti's. A simple mahogany desk is surrounded by black leather seats. As Ikgalef motions you to sit, an intricate machine built in the desk fills you a cup of tea automatically.`

			`	"Captain <last>, my old friend! You have learnt our language!" Ikgalef motions excitedly and joyfully, momentarily forgetting about the meeting. After a short while of passionate celebration, Ikgalef realises that Rek exists, and calms down.`
			`	"Greetings, President," Rek begins, "May I assume that the matter of the Anatruskor are also to be discussed today?"`
			`	"The Anatruskor Empire and the Sestor Federation are staunch allies. We will not give up our planets," Ikgalef says adamantly.`
			`	"President, I am here to inform you our planned settlement on Sek Alarfarat, an abandoned cracked planet."`
			`	"Sek Alarfarat is Anatruskor territory," Ikgalef's tone becomes considerably colder.`
			`	"It was, until the planet is cracked and the population perished," Rek responds, "Also, there are no direct links from current Anatruskor sectors to Fornarep."`
			`	Ikgalef's face darkens, as its gaze hardens. The Sestor President's anger, however, does not seem to be directed at Rek. Through gritted teeth, Ikgalef assents.`
			`	The first agenda seems to have been met quickly, and the discussion quickly turns to the matter of the Mereti.`
			`	"Ms. Representative, I take it that the Mereti are now part of you?"`
			`	"No. The Mereti are an independent gestalt that currently views terraforming as their primary directive. We aim to teach them."`
			`	"By terraforming, do they mean all the planets in Mereti space?"`
			`	"Currently their focus is on Korbatri Eska, but yes. All planets are slated for Mereti terraformation," replies Rek.`
			`	"The Sestor wants run ships through Mereti territory to facilitate closer cooperation," Ikgalef offers. To nobody's surprise, this is accepted.`
			`	With both goals completed, the negotiations end. Like last time, Rek wants to stay in Sopi Lefarkata for a while, so no return trip is needed. Before you leave, Ikgalef pulls you to the side.`
			`	"Okote'! You have learnt our language!" says Ikgalef, the second time, "Thanks to that, I won't need that cumbersome translator!"`
			`	With a holler of joy, Ikgalef leaps from the translator, and starts speaking directly to you in Sestor. A hand wave calls a few Korath aides forward, who quietly fold the translator up, and carry it to a small storage shed nearby.`
			`	"We must tread carefully, Okote'," Ikgalef says, "We must make sure the Efreti do not benefit from the Wanderers too much."`
			`	The bad blood between the Sestor and the Efreti need a lot of effort to breake.`
			`	"Another good news, Okote'! Our factories run at a surplus now, especially our fighter division. You are free to buy our Far Lek 14's and Far Osk 29's at our shipyards."`
			`	With that, the day ends. Compared to the Efreti negotiations, you do not get to change anything today. However, You cannot help but think that you are going to have a heavy hand in shaping the future of the Korath Space.`

Massive filters are installed, transforming toxic wastewater into harmless substances before passing into the ocean. Catalytic converters are installed on factory chimneys as well. Along the coastline, rows of pumps feed the polluted ocean water into special plants, cleaning the environment."
		spaceport "Solima Skarati's spaceport is the cumulation of the many lessons the Efreti have learnt in environmental protection. Large walkways and electric vehicles minimise emissions, and ubiquitous trees and gardens provide the spaceport with comparatively fresh air. Efreti freighters and space liners continue to pour in and out of this spaceport, relieving the other Efreti planets' overpopulation problems."

		description "Centuries of careless industrialisation have filled this planet's oceans with industrial toxins. The landscape is mostly barren, thanks to constant acid rains and powerful storms. Due to a strengthened greenhouse effect, the planet's surface temperature is also higher than normal."
		description "	The Wanderers established a city near the coast, while the Efreti base themselves further inland, an asphalt road connecting the two. With the Wanderers' help, the Efreti are in the process of installing advanced anti-pollution devices on the planet's many factories. In the future, this planet would be the model for green Korath industrialisation."
		spaceport "The joint Wanderer-Korath spaceport is much unlike any existing designs. Landing pads are elevated ten metres in the air, with movable platforms allowing easy transferral of goods and passengers from the pads to the many facilities downstairs. A train line runs from the spaceport to the two settlements on this planet."

		description "The first world with both Wanderer and Korath permanent inhabitants, Solima Skarati is a Korath model colony. Thanks to the Wanderers' waste treatment technology, factories are able to operate under strict environmental regulations without sacrificing productivity. Thanks to Korath protection technology, both Wanderers and Korath can walk around the polluted landscape without suffering from ill health effects."
		description "	The Korath and Wanderer inhabitants live next as neighbours and housemates in the planet's numerous cities, all interconnected by Korath-style trains and Wanderer-derived aircraft. With much economic opportunities, Solima Skarati is a desired destination for many evacuating Wanderers and Efreti Korath alike."
