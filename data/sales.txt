#Anatruskor pioneers raiding, and so most raiding weaponry are Anatruskor stuff. Grab-strike to hold ship in place, while their signature power damage weapons drain their power to nil.
#The reason why UHai has so much ion damage stuff.
#Shunt-Strike was Similisti stuff. During their downfall the government evacuated with the Shunt Strike tech. Mereti got the nanobots and made the Sayaiban concoction instead. 
#Grab-strikes seem to be universal. Banishers and Expellers Grav-weapons are Efreti inventions.
