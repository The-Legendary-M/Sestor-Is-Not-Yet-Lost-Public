# The Story:
30xx. The Wanderers have set up colonies in Spera Anatrusk and surrounding territories, formerly occupied by the Anatruskor Empire.
A few months later, the Alphas invaded Sestor Ikfar, hijacking most of the standing Sestor fleet, and transporting them to Zenith, where they would destroy the entire northern Republic space.

Thanks to a certain Captain, the Alpha invasion was thwarted. Leaderless, the Sestor drones were quickly shut down by invited Korath Exiles.
Although Sestor drones are still operated by the Exiles, the final vestiges of an independent Sestor Federation is gone.

...

Or has it?
Deep underground, in the secluded planet of Sopi Lefarkata, a coven of Sestor Korath lives. The decision of the Sestor Governmnent to spread out its remaining population proved to be its saving grace. Led by Ikgalef, the Sestor's former Foreign Minister and current Acting President, the Sestor Federation bides it time to rise to the skies once again.

The Sestor Federation is not yet lost, as it never shall be.

Long live the Federation. Long live democracy.

As the Sestor moves to reclaim its territories, the rest of the Galaxy does not stay still. 

The Kor Efret, long been enemies of the Sestor and the Mereti, know that the automaton threat is gone. Unwilling to be boxed inside their overpopulated, failing planets, the Efreti sets their eyes on the nearest habitable planets. In the territories of the Anatruskor, recently collapsed allies to the Sestor.

The Unfettered Hai, the reason the Wanderers have been retreating and resettling so hastily, waits for an opportunity to bypass the strong Pug Arfecta defensive line in the bunker sector of Ap'arak. A few months of building up and planning just might be the key to their Ultimate Victory. Just like how the True Hai once defeated flying dragons in the South, they shall now defeat flying birds in the North.

All is not well in the Wanderer territories. The two Pug Arfectas did stall the Unfettered Hai advance, but it did nothing to stop the Unfettered buildup. While most Wanderer leaders decided to focus solely on terraforming and developing Korath planets, some, like Sobari Tele'ek, sees they threat the Unfettered pose, once the Arfectas go and the Unfettered advance beyond.

When the Korath Exiles got their hands on Mereti and Sestor drones, they are ecstatic. Ships more powerful than their own, requiring no pilots to operate? Perfect accompanyment to carry out raids, ferry goods, and mine asteroids for resources! It seems like a flawless plan, but like all things that seem too good to be true, this is yet another example. The Korath Exiles pay for their hubris.

The Remnant discovery of the Sheragi Ssil Vida station spurred on a flurry of scientific advancement. For centuries, they have been raided by the Korath. Paranoid, they send scouting fleets throughout the Ember Wastes, wary of any intruders other than the Korath. After all, they cannot be raided when nobody knows they exist. Although the Deep have been scouting the Wastes, they have yet to discover their way through to them. And then, scanners pick up unexpected visitors arriving right at their doorstep.

The future is yet uncertain, filled with too many variables to predict. The time's a-changing, and no faction will emerge from it unchanged.
