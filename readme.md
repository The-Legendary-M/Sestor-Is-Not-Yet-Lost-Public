# The Story:
30xx. The Wanderers have set up colonies in Spera Anatrusk and surrounding territories, formerly occupied by the Anatruskor Empire.
A few months later, the Alphas invaded Sestor Ikfar, hijacking most of the standing Sestor fleet, and transporting them to Zenith, where they would destroy the entire northern Republic space.

Thanks to a certain Captain, the Alpha invasion was thwarted. Leaderless, the Sestor drones were quickly shut down by invited Korath Exiles.
Although Sestor drones are still operated by the Exiles, the final vestiges of an independent Sestor Federation is gone.

...

Or has it?
Deep underground, in the secluded planet of Sopi Lefarkata, a coven of Sestor Korath lives. The decision of the Sestor Governmnent to spread out its remaining population proved to be its saving grace. Led by Ikgalef, the Sestor's former Foreign Minister and current Acting President, the Sestor Federation bides it time to rise to the skies once again.

The Sestor Federation is not yet lost, as it never shall be.

Long live the Federation. Long live democracy.
